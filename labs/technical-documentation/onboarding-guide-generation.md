## Quick Start

Pick a repo below, copy the **Step 1** prompt into a new Devin session, and let Devin analyze the codebase and generate a developer onboarding guide. No prerequisites beyond repo access.

---

## Challenge

Create comprehensive developer onboarding guides from repo analysis. The guide should help a new developer understand the codebase architecture, setup process, development workflow, and key patterns used throughout the project.

## Target Outcomes

- Developer onboarding guide covering architecture overview, local setup, and development workflow
- Codebase map showing key directories, modules, and their responsibilities
- Common task guides (adding a feature, fixing a bug, running tests)
- All onboarding documents placed in `docs/onboarding/`
- PR with onboarding documentation

## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin explores and maps unfamiliar codebases to identify key architectural patterns
- How Devin generates structured documentation from code analysis
- How Devin identifies setup steps, dependencies, and common development workflows
- The value of asking Devin to target specific audiences (new hires, contractors, etc.) in prompts

## Devin Features Exercised

- Codebase analysis and architecture mapping
- Documentation generation and technical writing
- Developer experience design
- PR creation with documentation artifacts

## Difficulty

Intermediate

## Estimated Time

45 minutes

## Notes

- Encourage participants to compare Devin's generated guide against their own onboarding experience — what did Devin miss or get right?
- Good follow-up: have a participant who is unfamiliar with the repo try to follow the generated guide
- The guide should be specific to the repo, not generic — it should reference actual file paths, commands, and patterns

## Repositories

### <a id="uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction"></a>uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction

**Repository:** [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction)

Spring Boot monolith with a Next.js frontend — a complex full-stack application ideal for testing onboarding guide quality.

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```
Analyze the uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction repository and create a comprehensive developer onboarding guide in `docs/onboarding/`. Generate: (1) `architecture-overview.md` — high-level architecture diagram (in markdown/mermaid) showing backend services, frontend, database, and their interactions, (2) `local-setup-guide.md` — step-by-step setup instructions with prerequisites, environment variables, and verification steps, (3) `codebase-map.md` — directory-by-directory guide explaining what each module does and where to find key files, and (4) `common-tasks.md` — how-to guides for adding a new API endpoint, adding a frontend page, running tests, and debugging common issues.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What are the main architectural layers in uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction? How do the backend and frontend communicate?"*
- *"What build tools, test frameworks, and development scripts are available? What does a typical development workflow look like?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to cross-reference Devin's generated architecture overview. Check if any modules or patterns were missed in the onboarding guide.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — does the setup guide include all prerequisites and environment variables needed to run the app locally?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add a troubleshooting section covering common setup failures (port conflicts, missing dependencies, database issues)
- **Watch Devin respond** and push a follow-up commit

### <a id="calcom"></a>calcom

**Repository:** [calcom](https://github.com/codev-workshops/calcom)

Large-scale open-source scheduling platform with a complex monorepo structure — a challenging codebase for onboarding guide generation.

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```
Analyze the calcom repository and create a developer onboarding guide in `docs/onboarding/`. Generate: (1) `architecture-overview.md` — high-level architecture showing the monorepo structure, key apps (web, api/v1, api/v2), shared packages, and how they interact, (2) `local-setup-guide.md` — step-by-step setup covering Node.js/Yarn prerequisites, database setup, environment configuration, and verification, (3) `codebase-map.md` — guide to the monorepo layout explaining what each app and package does, and (4) `common-tasks.md` — how-to guides for adding a new tRPC endpoint, creating a new UI component, modifying the database schema, and running tests.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What is the monorepo structure of Cal.com? What are the key apps and packages, and how do they depend on each other?"*
- *"What is the development workflow for Cal.com? How do Turborepo, Prisma, and tRPC fit together in the build and development process?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the full monorepo architecture. A project this large will have patterns and conventions that are critical for the onboarding guide to capture.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — does the codebase map accurately capture the monorepo structure and package dependencies?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add a section on the embed system and how platform integrations work
- **Watch Devin respond** and push a follow-up commit

---

## Key Takeaways

- Devin generates onboarding guides grounded in the actual codebase — referencing real file paths, build commands, and configuration patterns rather than generic advice
- Onboarding documentation is a high-impact investment that teams rarely prioritize — Devin produces a solid first draft that teams can refine based on real onboarding experience
- Comparing Devin's generated guide against DeepWiki output is a useful exercise: DeepWiki provides auto-generated architectural context, while the onboarding guide adds human-oriented workflow guidance

## Going Further

Onboarding guides connect to **documentation-on-code-change triggers** (see [When to Use Devin → Capacity-Constrained](../../reference/general-themes/when-to-use-devin.md)):

- **PR-triggered guide updates** — When a PR adds a new module, changes the build process, or modifies environment requirements, trigger a Devin session that updates the relevant onboarding documents and opens a follow-up PR
- **Scheduled freshness checks** — Run a recurring session that verifies the setup guide still works: clone the repo, follow the documented steps, and report any failures. If the guide is outdated, Devin opens a PR with corrections
- **New-hire onboarding assist** — When a new team member joins, trigger a Devin session scoped to the repos they'll work on. Devin generates a personalized onboarding guide covering the specific services, patterns, and workflows relevant to their role
