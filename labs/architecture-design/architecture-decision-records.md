## Quick Start

1. Pick a repository below
2. Paste the sample prompt into Devin
3. Observe how Devin analyzes the codebase to infer architectural decisions and generates MADR-format ADRs
4. Review the PR and leave feedback — Devin will iterate on your comments

---

## Challenge

Analyze an existing codebase to identify key architectural decisions, then generate a set of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following the MADR template that document context, decision rationale, status, and consequences.

## Target Outcomes

- Set of ADR documents in `docs/adr/` following the MADR template
- Architecture diagram or description generated from code analysis
- List of identified architectural patterns and their rationale
- PR with ADR documents and any recommended architecture improvements

## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin performs deep codebase analysis to infer architectural decisions
- How Devin recognizes architectural patterns (layering, API styles, data access strategies)
- Devin's ability to produce structured technical documentation from code
- How to evaluate and refine AI-generated architectural documentation
- How **shared context** (knowledge notes with architecture decisions) helps Devin make better decisions on future tasks (see [Architecture Strengths → Shared Context Layer](../../reference/general-themes/architecture-strengths.md#shared-context-layer))

## Devin Features Exercised

- Deep codebase analysis
- Architectural pattern recognition
- Technical writing and documentation generation
- PR creation
- **Devin Review** — can reference ADRs when reviewing future PRs for architectural consistency (see [Platform Capabilities → Devin Review](../../reference/general-themes/platform-capabilities.md#devin-review))

## Difficulty

Intermediate

## Estimated Time

45 minutes

## Repositories

### <a id="uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction"></a>uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction

**Repository:** [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction)

Spring Boot monolith with both REST and GraphQL APIs, DGS framework integration, and multiple data access patterns — rich ground for architectural decision documentation.

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```text
Analyze the architecture of uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction. This is a Spring Boot monolith that uses both REST controllers and GraphQL via the DGS framework. Identify the key architectural decisions — including why both REST and GraphQL coexist, the choice of the DGS framework, data access patterns (MyBatis vs JPA), the security model, and the monolithic structure. Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `docs/adr/` following the MADR template (Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences). Also produce a high-level architecture description in `docs/adr/README.md`.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What are the main architectural layers in uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction, and how do requests flow from the API layer to the database?"*
- *"Why does this application use both REST and GraphQL? Are there specific endpoints that are only available through one API style?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the full architecture — the dual API surface, data access layer, and security configuration. Identify which design decisions are explicit (documented) versus implicit (inferred from code structure).

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — do the ADRs accurately capture the real decisions, or are they generic boilerplate?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add an ADR for a specific decision you notice (e.g., the choice of SQLite for development, the frontend/backend separation)

### <a id="timesheet-app"></a>timesheet-app

**Repository:** [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app)

Node.js/Express backend with a React frontend — a different tech stack that exercises Devin's ability to recognize architecture decisions across languages and frameworks.

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```text
Analyze the architecture of timesheet-app. This is a Node.js/Express + React application. Identify the key architectural decisions — including the frontend/backend separation strategy, API design approach, authentication mechanism, database choice, and state management patterns. Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `docs/adr/` using the MADR template (Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences). Include an `docs/adr/README.md` that summarizes the overall architecture.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"How is the timesheet-app project structured? What is the separation between frontend and backend, and how do they communicate?"*
- *"What database and ORM/data access patterns does timesheet-app use? Are there any architectural trade-offs visible in the codebase?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the project structure and technology choices. Look for patterns that reveal implicit architectural decisions — middleware chains, folder organization, and configuration files.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — are the ADRs specific to this codebase or could they apply to any Express app?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to strengthen the "Consequences" section of a specific ADR with concrete trade-offs observed in the code

---

## Key Takeaways

- Devin can infer architectural decisions from code structure and produce structured ADR documentation following the MADR template
- ADRs generated from code analysis are more specific than hand-written ones because they reference actual patterns observed in the codebase
- The PR feedback loop lets reviewers refine ADRs (e.g., "add an ADR for this specific decision") and Devin follows up
- Generated ADRs can be added to Devin's knowledge notes so future sessions understand the team's architectural conventions
- Devin Review can reference ADRs when reviewing future PRs, flagging changes that contradict documented decisions

---

## Going Further

- **Scheduled architecture documentation refresh** — run Devin on a monthly schedule to analyze code changes since the last ADR update and propose new or revised ADRs (see [Platform Capabilities → Scheduled Sessions](../../reference/general-themes/platform-capabilities.md#scheduled-sessions))
- **ADRs as shared context** — add generated ADRs to Devin's knowledge notes so every future session understands the team's architectural decisions and conventions (see [Architecture Strengths → Shared Context Layer](../../reference/general-themes/architecture-strengths.md#shared-context-layer))
- **Parallel ADR generation across repos** — use child agents to generate ADRs for multiple repositories simultaneously, each following the same MADR template (see [Platform Capabilities → Child Agents](../../reference/general-themes/platform-capabilities.md#child-agents-divide-and-conquer))
