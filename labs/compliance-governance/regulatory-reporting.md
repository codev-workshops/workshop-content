## Challenge

Generate comprehensive compliance reports from SAST, DAST, and dependency scan outputs. Aggregate findings into executive-ready reports with remediation timelines and risk assessments.

## Quick Start

Paste this prompt into Devin to get started immediately:

```
Run ./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze on
uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance to generate a
dependency vulnerability report. Then analyze the
results and produce a comprehensive regulatory
compliance report with three sections:
(1) an executive summary with a risk dashboard showing
    total findings by severity, top-risk components,
    and overall compliance posture;
(2) a detailed findings section with each vulnerability,
    its CVSS score, affected component, and business
    impact;
(3) a remediation plan with prioritized actions,
    estimated effort, and a timeline.
Save the report as REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md.
Also create a reports/ directory with the raw scan
output and a reporting-framework.md that documents how
to regenerate these reports.
```

## Target Outcomes

- Aggregated compliance report from multiple scan sources
- Executive summary with risk dashboard
- Remediation plan with prioritized findings and timelines
- PR with reporting framework and generated reports

## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin aggregates and correlates findings from multiple security scanning tools
- How Devin generates executive-ready reports from raw scan data
- How to evaluate risk prioritization and remediation timelines produced by Devin
- How Devin structures compliance documentation for regulatory audiences

## Devin Features Exercised

- Multi-source data aggregation and correlation
- Report generation with structured formatting
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Technical writing for compliance documentation

## Difficulty

Intermediate

## Estimated Time

**Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)

Spring Boot application with pre-configured OWASP Dependency-Check and SonarQube Gradle plugins — provides real scan output to aggregate into compliance reports.

### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```
Run ./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze on
uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance to generate a
dependency vulnerability report. Then analyze the
results and produce a comprehensive regulatory
compliance report with three sections:
(1) an executive summary with a risk dashboard showing
    total findings by severity, top-risk components,
    and overall compliance posture;
(2) a detailed findings section with each vulnerability,
    its CVSS score, affected component, and business
    impact;
(3) a remediation plan with prioritized actions,
    estimated effort, and a timeline.
Save the report as REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md.
Also create a reports/ directory with the raw scan
output and a reporting-framework.md that documents how
to regenerate these reports.
```

### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What regulatory frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS) are relevant to the types of vulnerabilities found in uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance?"*
- *"How should vulnerability findings be mapped to specific compliance control requirements for audit purposes?"*

### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the application architecture and dependency landscape. This context helps evaluate whether the compliance report accurately reflects the risk posture of the application.

### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — does the executive summary accurately reflect the scan findings? Is the remediation timeline realistic?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add a compliance tracking spreadsheet (CSV) that maps each finding to a specific regulatory control (e.g., PCI DSS Requirement 6.2)
- **Watch Devin respond** and push a follow-up commit

### Key Takeaways

- **Executive-ready output**: The three-section report structure (executive summary → detailed findings → remediation plan) serves different audiences — leadership, security teams, and developers
- **Risk dashboard**: Aggregating findings by severity and component gives a visual overview of compliance posture that is immediately actionable
- **Regulatory mapping**: Linking CVEs to specific compliance controls (SOC 2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001) transforms a technical scan report into an audit-ready document
- **Reproducible reporting**: The `reporting-framework.md` documents how to regenerate reports, enabling consistent compliance reporting across audit cycles

## Going Further

- **Webhook-driven automation**: Connect your CI pipeline to Devin so that every merge to main automatically triggers a compliance report regeneration. The updated report is committed to the repo, providing a continuous audit trail of your compliance posture — no manual report generation needed.
- **Divide and conquer with child sessions**: When producing compliance reports across a microservices estate, use a parent Devin session to define the reporting template and regulatory framework mapping, then spawn child sessions — one per service — to scan and produce per-service reports in parallel. The parent aggregates results into an organization-wide compliance dashboard.
- **Scheduled recurring analysis**: Configure a monthly or quarterly scheduled Devin session to regenerate compliance reports automatically. This ensures reports stay current for audit cycles (SOC 2 annual, PCI DSS quarterly) without manual effort. Combine with Knowledge notes that encode your organization's regulatory mapping rules so that every report generation session applies the same control framework consistently.
