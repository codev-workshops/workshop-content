<a id="challenge"></a>
## Challenge

Use Devin to review pull requests — both Devin-generated PRs and human-authored PRs. This exercises Devin's code review capabilities: identifying bugs, suggesting improvements, checking for best practices, and providing actionable feedback. Devin Review can also be enabled as an automatic reviewer on repositories, providing consistent code review quality across the team.

<a id="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

Paste this into a new Devin session to get started immediately:

```
Review the open PR on timesheet-app. Check for: security
issues (SQL injection, XSS, missing input validation),
performance problems (N+1 queries, missing indexes), code
style violations, missing error handling, and test
coverage gaps. Leave inline comments on specific lines
with suggested fixes. Provide an overall review summary.
```

<a id="target-outcomes"></a>
## Target Outcomes

- PR reviewed with actionable inline comments
- Bugs, security issues, or style violations identified
- Improvement suggestions with code examples
- Review summary with severity-ranked findings

<a id="what-participants-will-learn"></a>
## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin reviews code for correctness, security, and style
- How Devin provides inline comments with code suggestions
- The difference between reviewing your own PR vs. someone else's
- How to use Devin as a "second pair of eyes" before merging
- How Devin Review operates as an automatic reviewer on every PR, not just when manually triggered

<a id="devin-features-exercised"></a>
## Devin Features Exercised

- PR review and inline commenting
- Code analysis for bugs and antipatterns
- Security review
- Style and convention checking
- Devin Review (automatic PR review)

## Difficulty

Beginner to Intermediate

## Estimated Time

30 minutes

## Notes

- This challenge works best after another challenge has produced a PR to review
- Can also review PRs from other participants in the workshop
- Try Devin Review as a continuous code review assistant for daily development

## <a id="timesheet-app"></a>timesheet-app

**Repository:** [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app)

Node.js/Express + React application — review PRs for JavaScript/TypeScript best practices.

### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```
Review the open PR on timesheet-app. Check for: security
issues (SQL injection, XSS, missing input validation),
performance problems (N+1 queries, missing indexes), code
style violations, missing error handling, and test
coverage gaps. Leave inline comments on specific lines
with suggested fixes. Provide an overall review summary.
```

### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What are the most common security issues in Express.js applications that I should look for in PRs?"*
- *"What code review checklist should I use for React + Express applications?"*

### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the codebase conventions. A good review should flag deviations from established patterns.

### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Meta-review** — evaluate Devin's code review comments for accuracy and helpfulness
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to also check for accessibility issues in any React component changes

### Key Takeaways

- Devin's reviews are actionable — each comment includes a specific suggestion, not just a vague concern
- Security reviews catch issues that functional testing misses (input validation, XSS, SQL injection)
- Meta-reviewing Devin's comments helps calibrate your team's expectations for AI code review

## <a id="ts-java-spring-boot-realworld"></a>ts-java-spring-boot-realworld

**Repository:** [ts-java-spring-boot-realworld](https://github.com/codev-workshops/ts-java-spring-boot-realworld)

Spring Boot Java application — review PRs for Java best practices and Spring patterns.

### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```
Review the open PR on ts-java-spring-boot-realworld.
Check for: proper exception handling, Spring dependency
injection patterns, JPA entity design, REST API
conventions, and test coverage. Leave inline comments
with suggested improvements. Provide a review summary.
```

### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What Spring Boot antipatterns should I look for in code reviews?"*
- *"What JPA/Hibernate pitfalls are common in Spring Boot applications?"*

### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the existing code patterns. Flag any PR changes that deviate from established conventions.

### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Meta-review** — are Devin's review comments accurate and actionable?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to prioritize findings by severity (critical, major, minor, nitpick)

### Key Takeaways

- Spring-specific reviews catch framework misuse (wrong scope for beans, missing transaction boundaries, N+1 JPA queries)
- Severity ranking helps developers focus on the most impactful issues first
- Devin understands Spring Boot conventions and flags deviations

## <a id="uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction"></a>uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction

**Repository:** [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction)

Spring Boot monolith with GraphQL + REST — review PRs for architectural consistency.

### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```
Review the open PR on
uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction. Focus on:
architectural consistency (does the change follow existing
patterns?), Spring Security configuration, GraphQL schema
design, database migration safety, and test coverage.
Leave inline comments and provide a summary.
```

### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What should I look for when reviewing a Spring Boot 2 to 3 upgrade PR? What are common mistakes?"*
- *"What GraphQL schema design issues should I flag in code reviews?"*

### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the architecture. Use this as a baseline for reviewing whether PR changes maintain architectural integrity.

### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Meta-review** — did Devin catch the most important issues? Did it miss anything?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to generate a review checklist specific to this repository

### Key Takeaways

- Architectural reviews require understanding the system's design patterns — Devin uses DeepWiki context to inform its review
- GraphQL schema changes can have cascading effects on clients — reviews should check for backwards compatibility
- A repository-specific review checklist encoded as a Knowledge item makes future reviews more consistent

## Going Further

### Devin Review as Automatic Reviewer

Enable Devin Review on your repositories to get automatic code reviews on every PR:

- Devin Review runs automatically when a PR is opened or updated
- Reviews cover security, performance, style, and correctness
- Findings are posted as inline PR comments with severity levels
- Knowledge items customize the review criteria for each repository

This turns code review from a bottleneck (waiting for a human reviewer) into an immediate feedback loop.

### Webhook-Driven Review Assignment

When a PR is opened, automatically trigger a Devin session for an in-depth review:

```
PR opened (pull_request.opened)
    → GitHub webhook fires
    → Devin session starts: "Review PR #N. Check for
       security issues, performance problems, and
       adherence to the project's coding standards."
    → Devin posts inline comments and a review summary
```

### Scheduled Review Audit

Configure a weekly Devin session to audit unreviewed PRs and PRs with outstanding review comments:

- Identify PRs that have been open for more than 48 hours without a review
- Re-review PRs where requested changes haven't been addressed
- Report a summary of review coverage and turnaround times

### Team-Based Review Standards

Use Knowledge items to encode team-specific review standards that Devin applies consistently across all reviewers and all PRs — eliminating inconsistency between different human reviewers' preferences.
