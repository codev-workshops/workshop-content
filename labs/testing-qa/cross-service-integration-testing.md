## Challenge

Write integration tests that validate the HTTP contract between the refactored monolith and the newly extracted Order microservice. This is the second phase of the cloud-native modernization narrative: after extracting a service (MM15), participants must prove the two systems work together correctly before deploying to Kubernetes. Cross-service integration testing is often the gap where production issues hide — Devin understands both sides of the contract.

<a id="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

Paste this into a new Devin session to get started immediately:

```
Write integration tests for the HTTP contract between the
QuickApp monolith and the extracted Order microservice.

Context:
- The monolith in quickapp-monolith now calls the Order
  service via an HTTP client
- The Order service in quickapp-microservices exposes REST
  endpoints for order management
- Both services share contract DTOs from Shared.Contracts

Deliverables:
1. Integration test project (tests/Integration/) targeting
   both services
2. Docker Compose test configuration
   (docker-compose.test.yml) that spins up the monolith,
   order-service, and PostgreSQL with test seed data
3. Contract tests covering: create order (POST), get order
   by ID (GET), list orders (GET), update order status
   (PUT), and error responses (404, 400)
```

<a id="target-outcomes"></a>
## Target Outcomes

- Integration test project that validates the monolith-to-microservice HTTP contract
- Docker Compose test environment that spins up both services with test databases
- Contract tests verifying: order creation, order retrieval, order status updates, error handling
- End-to-end flow test: monolith creates order via HTTP client → Order service processes and persists → monolith receives confirmation
- Shared contract validation: DTOs serialized by the monolith deserialize correctly in the microservice (and vice versa)
- PR with integration test suite and test infrastructure

<a id="what-participants-will-learn"></a>
## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin generates contract tests for inter-service HTTP communication
- Integration testing patterns for distributed .NET systems (WebApplicationFactory, TestContainers)
- Docker Compose as a test orchestration tool
- The importance of testing service boundaries before production deployment
- How to validate shared contract compatibility between services

<a id="devin-features-exercised"></a>
## Devin Features Exercised

- Multi-repo code analysis (understanding both sides of the HTTP contract)
- Test generation (.NET xUnit/NUnit integration tests)
- Docker Compose orchestration for test environments
- HTTP client testing patterns
- PR creation with test evidence

## Difficulty

Intermediate

## Estimated Time

45 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Completion of MM15 (or a pre-decomposed branch with the Order service already extracted)
- Docker available for running the test environment
- Both repos cloned and accessible to Devin

## Notes

- If participants haven't completed MM15, they can use the `main` branch of the microservices repo which has the service scaffold — but the tests will need the services to be implemented
- The integration tests should run locally via Docker Compose with no external dependencies
- This lab feeds into MM17 (cross-service bug hunt) where participants use similar debugging skills

The monolith should have been refactored in MM15 to call the Order service via HTTP. The integration tests validate this HTTP boundary.

### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```
Write integration tests for the HTTP contract between the
QuickApp monolith and the extracted Order microservice.

Work on branch workshop-<attendee_id>.

Context:
- The monolith in quickapp-monolith now calls the Order
  service via an HTTP client (refactored in the previous
  lab)
- The Order service in quickapp-microservices exposes REST
  endpoints for order management
- Both services share contract DTOs from Shared.Contracts

Deliverables:
1. Integration test project (tests/Integration/) targeting
   both services
2. Docker Compose test configuration
   (docker-compose.test.yml) that spins up the monolith,
   order-service, and PostgreSQL with test seed data
3. Contract tests covering: create order (POST), get order
   by ID (GET), list orders (GET), update order status
   (PUT), and error responses (404, 400)
4. End-to-end flow test: create a customer in the monolith
   → place an order through the monolith → verify the
   order exists in the Order service database → verify the
   monolith's HTTP client received the correct response
5. Shared contract serialization test: verify that DTOs
   roundtrip correctly between the two services
```

### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What are the critical failure modes when the monolith calls the Order service? How should we test timeouts, network errors, and malformed responses?"*
- *"Should we use WebApplicationFactory for in-process testing or TestContainers for full Docker-based integration testing? What are the trade-offs?"*
- *"What test data strategy should we use? Seed data per test, shared fixtures, or database-per-test?"*

### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Review both repos to understand the HTTP contract:
1. **Monolith** — Find the `OrderServiceClient` (or equivalent HTTP client) and understand what endpoints it calls and what DTOs it expects
2. **Order service** — Find the controller endpoints and understand what request/response shapes they use
3. **Shared contracts** — Verify which DTOs are shared between the services

### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review test coverage** — Are all CRUD operations tested? Are error scenarios covered?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add specific tests:
  - *"Add a test for concurrent order creation — what happens when two orders are placed simultaneously?"*
  - *"Add a contract backwards-compatibility test — if we add a new field to OrderDto, does the old client still work?"*
  - *"Add a performance test that creates 100 orders and verifies throughput"*

### Key Takeaways

- Cross-service integration tests are the safety net between extraction and deployment
- Docker Compose test environments ensure tests run identically in CI and locally
- Shared contract serialization tests catch the most subtle inter-service bugs

The extracted Order service with REST endpoints. Integration tests validate the contract from the monolith's perspective.

### Key Takeaways

- The provider side of integration tests verifies that the service API matches what consumers expect
- Docker Compose orchestration makes the multi-service test environment reproducible

## Going Further

### Event-Driven Contract Verification

When either service's API changes, automatically trigger integration tests:

```
PR modifies OrderController or OrderServiceClient
    → CI triggers cross-service integration test suite
    → If tests fail, Devin session starts:
       "Integration tests failed after API changes in
        the Order service. Diagnose and fix the contract
        mismatch."
    → Devin opens a PR on the affected repo
```

### Scheduled Integration Health Checks

Configure a daily Devin session to run the cross-service integration tests against the latest builds of both services. This catches drift between services that deploy on different schedules.

### Divide and Conquer for Multi-Service Testing

For architectures with many services, spawn child Devin sessions to generate integration tests for each service boundary in parallel. Each child focuses on one consumer-provider pair.
