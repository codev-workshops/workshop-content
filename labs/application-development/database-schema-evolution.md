## Quick Start

1. Pick a repository below
2. Paste the sample prompt into Devin
3. Observe how Devin creates versioned migration scripts and updates application code
4. Review the PR and leave feedback — Devin will iterate on your comments

---

## Challenge

Plan and execute a database schema evolution — adding new tables, modifying columns, creating indexes, or restructuring relationships — using proper migration tooling (Flyway, Liquibase, Knex migrations, etc.) to ensure changes are versioned, reversible, and safe.

## Target Outcomes

- Database migration script(s) created using the project's migration framework
- Schema changes applied successfully with data preserved
- Rollback script or down migration verified
- Application code updated to work with the new schema
- PR with migration files and updated code

## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin works with database migration frameworks (Flyway, Liquibase, Knex)
- How Devin plans schema changes that preserve existing data
- The importance of reversible migrations and rollback strategies
- How to validate schema changes against running applications
- How the **PR feedback loop** works — reviewers comment, Devin iterates, CI re-runs (see [Collaboration Model](../../reference/general-themes/collaboration-model.md))

## Devin Features Exercised

- Database schema design
- Migration framework usage
- Application code refactoring for schema changes
- PR creation with migration documentation
- **Devin Review** — can catch migration issues (missing rollbacks, ordering problems) before human review (see [Platform Capabilities → Devin Review](../../reference/general-themes/platform-capabilities.md#devin-review))

## Difficulty

## Repositories

### <a id="timesheet-app"></a>timesheet-app

**Repository:** [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app)

Node.js/Express with SQLite — add or modify database migrations to support new features or schema improvements.

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```text
Add a database migration system to timesheet-app using Knex.js (or the existing migration approach). Create a migration that adds a "projects" table with columns: id, name, description, client_id (FK to clients), start_date, end_date, status, created_at, updated_at. Add an index on client_id. Create a second migration that adds a project_id column to the work_entries table. Ensure both migrations have rollback (down) functions.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What migration framework does timesheet-app currently use? If none, what's the best option for SQLite + Express?"*
- *"How should we handle the foreign key from work_entries to projects — nullable (gradual migration) or required (breaking change)?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the current database schema and ORM usage. Plan the migration to be compatible with the existing data access patterns.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — do the migrations handle existing data correctly? Are rollbacks safe?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add a seed script that populates sample project data

### <a id="uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization"></a>uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization

**Repository:** [uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization)

Spring Boot with JPA and H2 — add Flyway migrations for schema evolution.

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```text
Add Flyway database migration support to uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization. Create versioned migration scripts that: (1) create the modern schema tables from data/modern-schema/modern_tables.sql, (2) add audit columns (created_at, updated_at, created_by) to all modern tables, (3) add a loan_payment_history table for payment tracking. Configure Flyway in application.properties. Verify migrations run on startup.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"Does this project already use any database migration tool? If not, is Flyway or Liquibase a better fit for Spring Boot 3.x?"*
- *"How should the migration handle the coexistence of legacy and modern schemas in H2?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the current schema setup and JPA entity definitions. Plan migrations that align with the existing entity model.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — are migration version numbers correct? Will they run in the right order?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add a migration that creates database indexes on frequently queried columns

### <a id="uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction"></a>uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction

**Repository:** [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction)

Spring Boot with Flyway and MyBatis — add new migrations for schema changes.

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin

```text
Review the existing Flyway migrations in uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction. Add new migrations that: (1) add a "bookmarks" join table between users and articles, (2) add a "tags" count column to articles for denormalized tag counting, (3) add database indexes on commonly queried columns (article slug, user email). Ensure all existing tests still pass.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What Flyway migrations already exist? What schema version is the database currently at?"*
- *"What columns would benefit most from database indexes based on the MyBatis query patterns?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the existing schema and query patterns. Identify which tables and columns would benefit from indexing.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — are the migrations idempotent? Do they handle the case where the table already exists?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add a migration validation test that verifies schema state after all migrations run

---

## Key Takeaways

- Devin works with standard migration frameworks (Flyway, Liquibase, Knex) to produce versioned, reversible schema changes
- Migration scripts should include both up and down (rollback) functions for safe deployments
- The PR feedback loop lets reviewers verify migration safety (data preservation, ordering, rollback) before merging
- Devin Review can catch common migration issues like missing rollbacks or incorrect version ordering
- Schema changes paired with application code updates demonstrate Devin's ability to handle coordinated multi-layer changes

## Going Further

- **Ticket-driven schema changes** — tag a Jira or GitHub Issue with `Devin:Implementation` and Devin picks it up automatically, creates migration scripts, updates application code, and opens a PR linked back to the ticket (see [Design Patterns → Event-Driven Triggers](../../reference/general-themes/design-patterns-for-devin.md#pattern-2-event-driven-triggers))
- **Scheduled schema health checks** — run Devin on a weekly schedule to analyze database queries for missing indexes, unused columns, and schema drift, then open remediation PRs (see [Platform Capabilities → Scheduled Sessions](../../reference/general-themes/platform-capabilities.md#scheduled-sessions))
- **Parallel migration across services** — use child agents to apply the same schema pattern (e.g., adding audit columns) across multiple microservices simultaneously, each following the same migration playbook (see [Platform Capabilities → Child Agents](../../reference/general-themes/platform-capabilities.md#child-agents-divide-and-conquer))
