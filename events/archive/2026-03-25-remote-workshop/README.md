# Platform-Conformant Microservice Decomposition — 60-Minute Hands-on Lab

## Event Details

| | |
|---|---|
| **Variant Name** | Platform-Conformant Microservice Decomposition (60 min) |
| **Based On** | [workshops/by-tech-domain/modernization/platform-decomposition](../../../workshops/by-tech-domain/modernization/platform-decomposition/) |
| **Focus** | Monolith-to-microservices decomposition with IaC conformance on Kubernetes |
| **Duration** | 60 minutes |
| **Audience** | General |
| **Facilitator** | TBD |
| **Event Site** | Remote |

## Abstract

> Participants use Devin to decompose the Inventory bounded context from a .NET 8 + Angular 17 monolith into a standalone, platform-conformant microservice — complete with Helm chart, ArgoCD manifests, Dockerfile, CI/CD pipeline, and HTTP-based service communication.
>
> Devin reads four repositories simultaneously: the monolith source, existing IaC patterns, the platform engineering standard, and a landing repo for the new service. From a single prompt, Devin extracts the module, generates production-grade infrastructure-as-code, refactors the monolith, and creates PRs in both repos.
>
> **60-minute format:** This is a compressed version of the [full 90-minute lab](../../../workshops/by-tech-domain/modernization/platform-decomposition/). Bonus challenges and extended exploration are omitted. Participants launch the decomposition, explore with AskDevin/DeepWiki while Devin works, then review PRs and leave feedback.

## Lab Walkthrough

### Opening (5 min)

1. Welcome and introductions
2. Brief Devin overview — what it is, what it can do
3. Explain the 4-repo architecture using the table below:

| Repo | Role | Modified? |
|------|------|-----------|
| `ordermanager-monolith` | Source — extract the Inventory module from here | Yes — refactored to use HTTP client |
| `ordermanager-microservices` | Landing — new service code + service-level IaC goes here | Yes — new inventory-service directory |
| `platform-engineering-shared-services` | Context — defines what the platform expects | No — read-only reference |
| `ordermanager-iac` | Context — provides IaC patterns to follow | No — read-only reference |

4. Set expectations: Devin will take 10-15 minutes to produce initial PRs — that's normal for a complex multi-repo task

### Phase 1 — Launch the Decomposition (5 min)

Create a new Devin session and paste the following prompt. Replace `<participant>` with your name:

> Decompose the Inventory module from @codev-workshops/ordermanager-monolith into a standalone microservice.
>
> Work on branch workshop-mason in both repos.
>
> Use these repos as context for platform patterns and IaC standards:
> - @codev-workshops/platform-engineering-shared-services — defines the platform standard (namespaces, network policies, monitoring, ArgoCD)
> - @codev-workshops/ordermanager-iac — contains the existing Helm chart, Dockerfile, and ArgoCD patterns to follow
>
> Deliverables:
> - New .NET 8 Web API for the inventory-service with its own models, controllers, services, and EF Core DbContext
> - Angular 17 frontend components for inventory management
> - Dockerfile — multi-stage build following the pattern in ordermanager-iac/docker/Dockerfile
> - Helm chart — deployment, service, network policy, service monitor, HPA (follow ordermanager-iac/helm/)
> - ArgoCD application manifests for dev and staging (follow ordermanager-iac/argocd/)
> - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline — build, test, push to ECR, trigger ArgoCD sync
> - Monolith refactoring — replace in-process Inventory calls with an HTTP client that calls the new service
>
> Push the new inventory-service code and all service-level IaC to @codev-workshops/ordermanager-microservices on branch workshop-mason. Create a PR. Push the monolith refactoring changes to ordermanager-monolith on branch workshop-mason. Create a PR. Build and test both services locally to verify they work together.

### Phase 2 — Explore While Devin Works (15 min)

While Devin works autonomously, use these features to deepen your understanding:

#### AskDevin

Open a new AskDevin conversation and try:

- *"Analyze the domain boundaries in ordermanager-monolith. Which modules have clean boundaries and which are tightly coupled?"*
- *"Look at the Helm chart in ordermanager-iac and the namespace provisioning in platform-engineering-shared-services. What Kubernetes resources does a new microservice need to conform to the platform standard?"*

AskDevin uses advanced code search to produce detailed, accurately cited answers grounded in your codebase. Notice how it references specific files and line numbers in its responses.

> **Tip:** AskDevin is ideal for exploring and planning *before* starting a session. You can also **start a Devin session directly from an AskDevin conversation** — the prompt is automatically tailored with context from your discussion, leading to better results.

#### DeepWiki

Open each repo's DeepWiki page. Focus on:

1. **ordermanager-monolith** — module structure, shared models, dependency graph between Orders/Products/Customers/Inventory
2. **platform-engineering-shared-services** — namespace provisioning pattern, network policy defaults, monitoring setup

#### View Devin's Machine

While Devin is working, open the right side panel in the session by selecting the icon in the top right of the screen to see a live view of Devin's machine. This lets you:

- See the terminal output and file system in real time
- Observe how Devin navigates between repos
- Optionally run commands yourself in the IDE (e.g., `ls` the project structure, check a file Devin created)

#### Monitor Devin's Progress

Watch the session. Key milestones to look for:
- Devin reads all four repos and identifies the Inventory bounded context
- Devin creates the new .NET 8 Web API project structure
- Devin generates the Helm chart, Dockerfile, and ArgoCD manifests
- Devin refactors the monolith to use an HTTP client
- Devin runs tests and creates PRs

### Phase 3 — Interact and Refine (25 min)

While Devin works (or once it finishes), try these prompting exercises. Pick at least two:

#### Exercise A: Steer Devin Mid-Session

Provide one of these points of feedback directly in the Devin session chat to steer its behavior while it's still working:

**Ideally we have given Devin a prompt detailed enough for it to handle everything, but if it misses something, this is a good opportunity to show how to correct it:**

- *"Also add a PodDisruptionBudget to the Helm chart with minAvailable: 1"*
- *"Use Polly for circuit breaker and retry logic in the InventoryServiceClient"*
- *"Make sure the ArgoCD manifests target the decomposition-dev and decomposition-staging namespaces"*

Notice how Devin incorporates your feedback into its current work without starting over.

#### Exercise B: Generate a Refined Prompt with AskDevin

Now that you've seen what Devin produces, use AskDevin to craft a **better** version of the original prompt:

- *"Based on what you know about ordermanager-monolith and platform-engineering-shared-services, write me an optimized Devin session prompt to extract the Customers module as a microservice. Include specific file paths and patterns to follow."*

Compare the generated prompt to the one you used in Phase 1 — is it more specific? Would it produce better results?

Using Ask Devin is a great way to iteratively build up the relevant context and constraints for a task based on the underlying implementation details. By doing this, you can create more targeted and effective prompts for future tasks.

#### Exercise C: Create a Knowledge Item

Create a Knowledge entry in Devin that captures the platform conformance rules:

1. Go to **Sessions**
2. Send this prompt to Devin:

> Create a new Knowledge item titled "Platform Conformance Standard"
> Include rules like: *"All new microservices must include a Helm chart with network policy, service monitor, and HPA. ArgoCD manifests must target decomposition-dev and decomposition-staging namespaces. Dockerfiles must use multi-stage builds following the pattern in ordermanager-iac."*

3. Navigate to **Setting > Knowledge** and see the new knowledge items once Devin completes the task.

This simulates how teams encode organizational standards so that every Devin session follows them automatically.

Navigate to "Sessions" > "Explore Advanced Capabilities" > "Manage Knowledge". Here we can use Devin to help us manage and curate our Knowledge Items at scale. 

#### Exercise D: Review Session Insights

Open **Session Insights** for your running session:

- Review the timeline of activities — what did Devin do first? How did it plan its approach?
- Check the session size (ACU consumption)
- Hypothesize: how could you have gotten the same result with a shorter/cheaper session? (Hint: more specific file paths, fewer deliverables, or providing the Knowledge item from Exercise C upfront)

#### Exercise E: Launch a Parallel Session

Start a **second Devin session** with a different task against the same repos:

- *"Analyze the domain boundaries in ordermanager-monolith and produce a decomposition roadmap. For each module (Orders, Products, Customers, Inventory), assess coupling, shared models, and extraction difficulty. Output a markdown report with a recommended extraction order."*

This demonstrates running parallel sessions — one doing code work, one doing analysis.

#### Exercise F: Create a Playbook

After observing the decomposition workflow, create a Playbook that codifies it as a repeatable process:

You may also do this directly in the session by asking Devin to "Create a Playbook" using the session interface.

1. Go to **Settings > Playbooks**
2. Create a new playbook titled "Microservice Extraction Playbook"
3. Define the steps Devin should follow for any bounded context extraction:
   - Read the platform standard repos for IaC patterns
   - Identify the target module's boundaries and shared dependencies
   - Extract the module into a new .NET 8 Web API
   - Generate Helm chart, Dockerfile, ArgoCD manifests conformant to the platform standard
   - Refactor the monolith to use an HTTP client
   - Run tests and create PRs

Playbooks turn one-off prompts into reusable organizational workflows. Next time someone needs to extract a different module, they can invoke this playbook instead of writing a detailed prompt from scratch.

### Wrap-up (10 min)

1. Ask participants to share their most interesting finding from the PR review
2. Compare results across participants — did Devin make the same architectural decisions?
3. Highlight the key takeaway: code extraction + IaC generation + platform conformance in a single session
4. Point to the [full 90-minute version](../../../workshops/by-tech-domain/modernization/platform-decomposition/) and take-home extensions for continued learning
5. Collect feedback
