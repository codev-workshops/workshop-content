## Featured Labs

This event features 4 structured labs using purpose-built repositories:

### Lab 1 — Legacy Modernization: COBOL → Java (60 min)
- **Module:** [COBOL to Java](../../../labs/migration-modernization/cobol-to-java.md#uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java)
- **Repository:** [uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java)
- **Objective:** Explore a real COBOL mainframe application and use Devin to modernize part of it — you choose the scope, target, and approach

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

> Analyze the COBOL program CBACT01C.cbl in uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java. Understand its business logic, data structures (copybooks), and I/O operations. Rewrite it as a Java 17+ application using modern idioms. Create JUnit tests that verify the Java version produces identical results to the COBOL version for a set of sample inputs. Open a PR with the Java code and tests.

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and try:
- *"What are the most complex COBOL programs in uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java and what do they do?"*
- *"What would be the best Java architecture for migrating CBTRN01C.cbl? Consider Spring Boot, plain Java, or Kotlin."*
- Use the refined understanding to start a **second session** with a more targeted prompt

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to browse the auto-generated architecture diagrams and module explanations. Use what you learn to try something different:
- Pick a different COBOL program and compare how Devin handles it
- Try migrating to a different target (Kotlin, Python, Spring Boot service)
- Ask Devin to reverse-engineer business rules or generate a data dictionary
- Run parallel sessions migrating the same program to two different targets

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Once Devin opens a PR from step 1, practice the feedback loop:
- **Review the diff** — does the Java code faithfully represent the COBOL business logic?
- **Leave a comment on the PR** asking Devin to fix something (e.g., *"The packed decimal conversion doesn't handle negative values"* or *"Can you also generate a data dictionary for the copybooks?"*)
- **Watch Devin respond** to your PR comment and push a fix — this is how real teams work with Devin
- **Advanced: Try PR Review** — Open [this example PR review](https://partner-workshops.devinenterprise.com/review/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java/pull/1) to see Devin's **PR Review** feature in action — it provides an AI-powered summary and analysis of the changes. This is the most advanced way to review Devin's work.

See the [full challenge details](../../../labs/migration-modernization/cobol-to-java.md) for more ideas — there is no single right answer.

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Java/Kotlin/Python source code + tests with a working build
  - Parity tests: modern output matches COBOL output for provided fixtures
  - `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` describing field mappings and decisions
  - Technical documentation, data dictionary, or migration plan for the repo
  - PR with review comments and Devin's responses

### Lab 2 — Framework Upgrade & Refactor: Monolith → Microservices (60 min)
- **Module:** [Framework Upgrade](../../../labs/migration-modernization/framework-upgrade.md#uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction) + [Containerization & Microservice Extraction](../../../labs/migration-modernization/containerization-microservice-extraction.md#uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction)
- **Repository:** [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction)
- **Objective:** Take an older Java monolith (Java 11 + Spring Boot 2.6.3) and modernize it — you choose whether to focus on the upgrade, the microservice extraction, or both

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

> Upgrade uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction from Java 11 + Spring Boot 2.6.3 to Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.2. Handle the javax to jakarta namespace migration, update Gradle build configuration, fix any deprecations, and ensure all tests pass. Open a PR with the changes.

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What are the domain boundaries in uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction? Which bounded context would be easiest to extract as a microservice?"*
- *"What's the best order to tackle the javax to jakarta migration, the Gradle plugin updates, and the deprecated API removals?"*
- Use the refined understanding to start a **second session** — try extracting a microservice, or upgrade with a different strategy

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to browse the architecture, domain model, and dependency graph. Use what you learn to try something different:
- Extract a different bounded context (Articles, Users, or Comments) as a containerized microservice
- Have Devin produce an architecture decision record (ADR) for how the monolith should be decomposed
- Run parallel sessions — one upgrading the framework, one extracting a service
- Try the Angular upgrade on a different repo alongside the Spring Boot upgrade

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Once Devin opens a PR from step 1, practice the feedback loop:
- **Review the diff** — does the upgrade look complete? Are there files Devin missed?
- **Leave a comment on the PR** asking Devin to fix something (e.g., *"This still uses javax.servlet — please update to jakarta.servlet"* or *"Can you also add a Dockerfile?"*)
- **Watch Devin respond** to your PR comment and push a fix — this is how real teams work with Devin
- Try leaving both general comments and inline code comments to see how Devin handles each

See the full challenge details for [Framework Upgrade](../../../labs/migration-modernization/framework-upgrade.md) and [Containerization & Microservice Extraction](../../../labs/migration-modernization/containerization-microservice-extraction.md) for more ideas.

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Application builds and tests on Java 17+ / Spring Boot 3.x
  - One extracted microservice with its own Dockerfile and REST API
  - Docker Compose to run the full stack locally
  - Architecture decision record or migration report
  - PR with review comments and Devin's responses

### Lab 3 — CVE Remediations & Regulatory Code Standards (60 min)
- **Module:** [Upgrade Dependencies](../../../labs/security/upgrade-dependencies.md#uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance) + [Remediate Vulnerabilities](../../../labs/security/remediate-vulnerabilities.md#uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance) + [Shift Left Security](../../../labs/security/shift-left-security.md#uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)
- **Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)
- **Objective:** A Spring Boot 2.6.3 service has accumulated vulnerable dependencies (Spring4Shell, SnakeYAML RCE, SQLite JDBC RCE, and more). Scan, remediate, and add automated compliance checks
- **Known CVEs:** See the [full CVE findings report](../../../labs/security/remediate-vulnerabilities.md#uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance) for a breakdown of all 18+ known vulnerabilities by severity (5 Critical, 8 High, 5 Medium)

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

> Run `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze` on uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance to identify dependency CVEs. Remediate the top 5 most critical findings (CVSS >= 7.0) — start with Spring Boot 2.6.3, SnakeYAML 1.29, and sqlite-jdbc 3.36.0.3. Re-run the scan to verify the fixes. Create a `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` documenting the before/after results and open a PR.

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What are the known CVEs in uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance's dependencies? Which ones are CRITICAL severity?"*
- *"What's the safest upgrade path for Spring Boot 2.6.3 — should we go to 2.7.x first or jump straight to 3.x?"*
- Use the analysis to start a **second session** — try adding a GitHub Actions security scanning workflow, or upgrade Spring Boot to 3.x instead of just patching

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the codebase architecture. Use what you learn to try different approaches:
- Have Devin add **SBOM generation** (CycloneDX) to the build
- Ask Devin to add a **GitHub Actions workflow** that runs Trivy or OWASP Dependency-Check on every PR
- Try adding **SonarQube scanning** — the repo has a pre-configured `docker-compose.sonarqube.yml`
- Ask Devin to add **pre-commit hooks** for secrets detection (gitleaks)

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Once Devin opens a PR from step 1, practice the feedback loop:
- **Review the diff** — did Devin upgrade the right dependencies? Are there any it missed?
- **Leave a comment on the PR** asking Devin to fix something (e.g., *"Can you also add a CI workflow that fails on CRITICAL CVEs?"* or *"The SnakeYAML version still has CVE-2022-1471 — please upgrade to 2.x"*)
- **Watch Devin respond** to your PR comment and push a fix — this is how real teams work with Devin
- Try leaving both general comments and inline code comments to see how Devin handles each

See the full challenge details for [Upgrade Dependencies](../../../labs/security/upgrade-dependencies.md), [Remediate Vulnerabilities](../../../labs/security/remediate-vulnerabilities.md), and [Shift Left Security](../../../labs/security/shift-left-security.md) for more ideas.

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - OWASP Dependency-Check report with high/critical CVEs remediated
  - SBOM generated (CycloneDX or SPDX)
  - Secure coding checks added: SAST via SonarQube or Trivy
  - CI gating workflow: builds fail on policy violations
  - `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` with before/after evidence
  - PR with review comments and Devin's responses

### Lab 4 — DW Migration: Teradata → Snowflake (60 min)
- **Module:** [DW Migration: Teradata to Snowflake](../../../labs/data-engineering/dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake.md#uc-dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake)
- **Repository:** [uc-dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake)
- **Objective:** A Teradata-based data warehouse needs to be migrated to Snowflake. Convert DDL/DML, build a migration runbook, and set up validation

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

> Analyze all Teradata DDL in uc-dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake/ddl/. Convert every table and view to Snowflake-compatible SQL, handling all Teradata-specific features (SET/MULTISET, PRIMARY INDEX, PARTITION BY RANGE_N, COMPRESS, CASESPECIFIC, FORMAT, QUALIFY, CSUM, MAVG). Place converted files in a new snowflake/ directory mirroring the original structure. Create a MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md documenting every translation decision. Open a PR.

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What Teradata-specific features are used in uc-dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake and what are the Snowflake equivalents?"*
- *"What's the best approach for converting the BTEQ scripts in this repo to Snowflake-compatible SnowSQL or stored procedures?"*
- Use the analysis to start a **second session** — try converting the stored procedures and macros, or generate a full asset inventory

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to browse the schema structure and SQL patterns. Use what you learn to try different approaches:
- Have Devin convert the **stored procedures** (SCD Type 2, daily load, monthly snapshot) to Snowflake stored procedures
- Ask Devin to convert the **BTEQ scripts** to SnowSQL or Snowflake Tasks
- Try having Devin generate **validation queries** — Snowflake equivalents of the Teradata checksum queries in `data/validation/`
- Ask Devin to produce a **complete asset inventory** with migration status for every object

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Once Devin opens a PR from step 1, practice the feedback loop:
- **Review the diff** — does the SQL translation look correct? Are there Teradata features Devin missed?
- **Leave a comment on the PR** asking Devin to fix something (e.g., *"The CSUM() function wasn't translated — please convert to SUM() OVER()"* or *"Can you also convert the macros in dml/macros/?"*)
- **Watch Devin respond** to your PR comment and push a fix — this is how real teams work with Devin
- Try leaving inline comments on specific SQL statements to see how Devin handles dialect-level corrections

See the full challenge details in [DW Migration: Teradata to Snowflake](../../../labs/data-engineering/dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake.md) for more ideas — the repo includes a complete [Teradata features reference](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake/blob/initial-code/docs/teradata_features_reference.md) with Snowflake equivalents.

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Converted Snowflake DDL/DML for tables and views
  - Converted stored procedures or BTEQ scripts
  - `MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md` with translation decisions documented
  - Validation queries: Snowflake equivalents of Teradata checksums
  - `SQL_TRANSLATION_NOTES.md` mapping Teradata→Snowflake differences
  - PR with review comments and Devin's responses

## Additional Challenges

Participants may also attempt any challenge from the full [module catalog](../../../labs/) as creative inspiration. The labs above are the primary structured activities.

## Repos Required on Devin's Machine

- [x] uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java
- [x] uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction
- [x] uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance
- [x] uc-dw-migration-teradata-to-snowflake

## Repo Duplication Notes

Labs 2 and 3 both originate from `spring-boot-realworld-example-app` (Cluster C1 in [catalog](../../../catalog/repos.md)). They are intentionally separate repos so each lab gets an isolated starting point with no risk of cross-contamination during the workshop.

## Context

- **Audience:** Banking technology teams
- **Domain relevance:** Lab 4 uses Norwegian locale data (names, addresses, NOK currency) for relevance to the audience
- **Banking focus:** Labs 1 and 4 use financial/banking domain data (credit card processing, retail banking analytics)

## Devin Features Checklist

Encourage participants to track their progress on the [Devin Features Appendix](../../../labs/devin-features/README.md) throughout the day.
