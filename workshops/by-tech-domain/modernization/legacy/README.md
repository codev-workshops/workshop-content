# Workshop: Legacy Modernization

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Focus** | Modernizing legacy applications (COBOL, Oracle Forms/PL/SQL) to modern tech stacks with comprehensive testing |
| **Duration** | 2-4 hours per track (configurable — see Duration Variants below) |
| **Audience** | Enterprise architects, modernization teams, application portfolio managers |
| **Tracks** | **COBOL Track** (mainframe → Java) · **Oracle Forms Track** (Forms/PL/SQL → Spring Boot) |

## Workshop Narrative

This workshop follows a progressive modernization sequence that applies to **both** legacy platforms:

1. **Understand** — What does this legacy system do? (system inventory, dependencies, business rules, technical debt)
2. **Plan** — How should we modernize it? (strategy options, component mapping, phased cutover)
3. **Safeguard** — How do we know the migration is correct? (test harness, golden files, reconciliation)
4. **Execute** — Translate legacy code to modern tech stack with test validation

Each phase's output feeds the next, mirroring how real enterprise modernization programs operate. Participants choose the track matching their legacy platform — or try both in a full-day event.

## Getting the Most from This Workshop

> **Devin works asynchronously on its own machine.** Once you paste a prompt and kick off a session, Devin runs independently — you don't need to watch it. Move on to the next lab, explore Ask Devin, or grab coffee while it works. You'll get notified when it opens a PR.

A few tips to maximize your hands-on time:

- **Start sessions early, review later.** Kick off the session first, then use the wait time for Ask Devin research or reading DeepWiki — Devin keeps working in the background.
- **Use Ask Devin to refine requirements.** The better-defined a task is, the better Devin's output. Ask Devin helps you think through the problem before Devin executes.
- **Build up Devin's knowledge as you go.** When Devin suggests a Knowledge item, accept it — this is how teams build a shared context layer that compounds over time.
- **Leave PR comments to steer Devin.** After Devin opens a PR, you can leave comments and Devin will wake up and address them — this is the core feedback loop.
- **Try parallel sessions.** Running multiple sessions simultaneously mirrors real enterprise usage and demonstrates team-based operation at scale.

### Lab A1 — System Understanding & Reverse Engineering (60 min)

- **Module:** [COBOL System Understanding](../../../../labs/migration-modernization/cobol-system-understanding.md)

```
Analyze the entire COBOL codebase in uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java. Produce: (1) `APPLICATION_INVENTORY.md` cataloging all 30+ programs, copybooks, JCL jobs, and BMS maps with classifications, (2) `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` extracting business entities from copybook PIC clauses into a business-friendly format, (3) `DEPENDENCY_MAP.md` with the call graph and data lineage showing which programs call which and which jobs read/write which files, (4) `HOTSPOT_REPORT.md` with the top 10 modules prioritized by complexity, risk, and business impact.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

- *"What are the most complex COBOL programs in uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java? Which ones have the most copybook dependencies?"*
- *"What business domains does the CardDemo application cover — account management, transaction processing, customer management, or reporting?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to see how Devin auto-generates architecture documentation for COBOL. Try having Devin generate visual dependency graphs, complexity analysis, or reverse-engineer business rules from specific programs.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Extend it with: (1) Additional business scenarios covering edge cases — terminated employee payroll exclusion, overlapping leave requests, overtime with holidays, (2) Enhanced result comparator with financial tolerance rules and wildcard matching, (3) Per-module reconciliation checks — payroll totals must balance, leave balances must sum correctly, employee counts must match.
```

## Choosing a Track

| Audience Legacy Platform | Recommended Track | Event Guide |
|---|---|---|
| COBOL / Mainframe (CICS, JCL, VSAM, DB2) | Track A: COBOL Modernization | [COBOL Modernization Workshop](../../modernization/cobol/README.md) |
| Oracle Forms / PL/SQL (Forms Builder, Oracle DB) | Track B: Oracle Forms Modernization | [Oracle Forms Modernization Workshop](../../../../events/oracle-forms-modernization-workshop/README.md) |
| Mixed audience (both platforms represented) | Run both tracks in parallel — Labs 1 & 2 can share a room, split for Labs 3 & 4 | — |
| General modernization (not platform-specific) | Start with Track A (COBOL) — more dramatic "language barrier" story | — |

## Duration Variants

| Duration | Recommended Format |
|----------|-------------------|
| 8 hours (full day) | Both tracks: Track A (morning) + Track B (afternoon) or parallel tracks |
| 4+ hours | Single track: Lab 1 → Lab 2 → Lab 3 → Lab 4 |
| 3 hours | Single track: Labs 1, 3, 4 (skip planning, focus on understand → test → migrate) |
| 2 hours | Single track: Abbreviated Lab 1 (30 min) + Lab 4 (60 min) + discussion |
| 1 hour | Lab 4 only (code migration) or walkthrough with pre-built artifacts |

## Repos Required

### Track A (COBOL)

- [ ] uc-legacy-modernization-cobol-to-java

### Track B (Oracle Forms)

- [ ] ts-plsql-oracle-forms-hrms
- [ ] uc-legacy-modernization-oracle-forms-to-java

### Optional (for extended challenges)

## Key Takeaways

- **"Time-to-understanding drops from months to hours"** — dependency maps and data dictionaries produced in one session, regardless of the legacy platform
- **"Test before you migrate"** — building the safety net first is the single most important risk mitigation
- **"Informed migration, not blind translation"** — by Lab 4, participants have complete understanding, a strategy, and a test harness
- **"Technical debt resolved, not preserved"** — Devin fixes security vulnerabilities and performance issues during migration rather than translating bugs to the new platform
- **"Same methodology, different platforms"** — the Understand → Plan → Safeguard → Execute sequence works for COBOL, Oracle Forms, and any other legacy platform
