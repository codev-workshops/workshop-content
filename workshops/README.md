# Workshops

Hands-on, **choose-your-own-adventure** lab collections. Pick the workshop your facilitator assigned (or your interest), then pick the labs within it — there are no required sequences, solutions, or assessments here.

> **New to Devin?** Do the reading-first [`courses/`](../courses/) first — [Foundations](../courses/foundations/) (Level 1) and your [Track](../courses/tracks/) (Level 2) — then come here to apply it hands-on.

## Progression Model

```
Reading first (../courses/):
  Level 1: foundations/        ← Everyone starts here (concepts + product features)
  Level 2: tracks/    ← Role-specific training (sales / solutions / engineering)
    ↓
Hands-on (you are here, workshops/):
  Practice: general/           ← Broad hands-on tour
            otterworks/        ← Flagship monorepo deep-dive (300-level)
  Level 3:  by-tech-domain/    ← Deep-dives by technology area
            by-tech-role/      ← Deep-dives by job function
```

Reading/learning enablement (foundations + training tracks) lives in [`../courses/`](../courses/).

## How Labs Work

Every lab follows a 4-step format:

1. **Paste into Devin** — copy the prompt, kick off a session, and move on
2. **Research with Ask Devin** — use Ask Devin to explore the codebase while the session runs
3. **Explore with DeepWiki** *(optional)* — read the repo's auto-generated architecture docs
4. **Review & Give Feedback** — review the PR, leave comments, iterate with Devin

Labs reference individual modules from [`labs/`](../labs/) — the detailed challenge definitions.
