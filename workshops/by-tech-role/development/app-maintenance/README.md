# Workshop: Application Development and Maintenance

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Focus** | Feature development, bug fixing, code maintenance, and database evolution — the full lifecycle of keeping applications healthy and growing |
| **Duration** | Flexible (3 tracks, 3 labs each) |
| **Audience** | Development teams, full-stack engineers, application owners, and team leads responsible for shipping features and maintaining production applications |
| **Tracks** | **Track A:** Feature Development · **Track B:** Bug Fixing & Root Cause Analysis · **Track C:** Maintenance & Evolution |

## Workshop Narrative

This workshop covers the three pillars of application development and maintenance: building new capabilities, fixing production issues, and evolving the codebase over time. Each track is self-contained — participants can follow all three in sequence for a full-day experience, or focus on one or two tracks in a shorter session.

The tracks are designed to show Devin working across the application lifecycle:
- **Track A** shows Devin as a feature developer — gathering requirements, implementing full-stack changes, and iterating on PR Review feedback
- **Track B** shows Devin as a debugger and investigator — reproducing bugs, tracing root causes, and fixing issues across service boundaries
- **Track C** shows Devin as a maintenance engineer — upgrading dependencies, evolving schemas, refactoring tech debt, and automating ongoing hygiene

Beyond individual sessions, this workshop connects to three platform capabilities that turn one-off labs into sustainable maintenance practices. **Managed Devins** let a coordinator session spin up parallel workers — run the same dependency upgrade across ten repos simultaneously instead of one at a time. **Automations** (combining event-driven and schedule triggers) keep maintenance running without human initiation — a CI failure triggers an automatic fix session, or a weekly schedule runs dependency checks every Monday. **Security Swarm** adds proactive vulnerability scanning to the maintenance cadence, building a threat model tailored to your codebase and validating findings with evidence before surfacing them.

## Getting the Most from This Workshop

> **Devin works autonomously on its own machine.** Once you paste a prompt and kick off a session, Devin runs independently — you don't need to watch it. Move on to the next lab, explore Ask Devin, or grab coffee while it works. You'll get notified when it opens a PR.

A few tips to maximize your hands-on time:

- **Start sessions early, review later.** Each lab has a "Paste into Devin" step and a separate "Review & Give Feedback" step. Kick off the session first, then use the wait time for Ask Devin research or reading DeepWiki — Devin will keep working in the background.
- **Try parallel sessions.** Several labs suggest running multiple Devin sessions at once. This mirrors real enterprise usage where Devin handles repetitive work across many services.
- **Use Ask Devin to refine requirements before creating a session.** The better-defined a task is, the better Devin's output. Ask Devin helps you think through the problem first so Devin can execute with less back-and-forth.
- **Build up Devin's knowledge as you go.** When Devin suggests a Knowledge item during a session, accept it — this is how teams build a shared context layer that makes Devin smarter over time. You can also create Knowledge manually for project conventions and standards.
- **Leave PR comments to steer Devin.** After Devin opens a PR, the PR Review agent and CI checks provide automatic feedback loops. You can also leave comments directly on the PR and Devin will wake up and address them — this is the core workflow for iterating with Devin in production.
- **Explore Automations templates.** Pre-built templates like *CI Failure Fixer* and *Weekly Dependency Updates* turn one-off labs into repeatable automated workflows — set one up after completing a lab to see the pattern run hands-free.
- **Try Security Swarm for proactive scanning.** Security Swarm builds a threat model for your codebase and validates potential vulnerabilities with evidence. Use it as part of your application hygiene routine alongside dependency upgrades.
- **Scale with Managed Devins.** When a maintenance task applies to multiple repos, a coordinator session can spin up Managed Devins to run it in parallel — the same upgrade prompt across ten services at once.

## Track A: Feature Development

Track A demonstrates Devin as a feature developer. Participants will build full-stack CRUD features, implement API endpoints with test-driven development, and turn vague requirements into working implementations.

### Lab A1 — Full-Stack CRUD Feature

- **Module:** [New Feature Development](../../../../labs/application-development/new-feature-development.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app) — React 19 + Node.js/Express + SQLite full-stack application
  - [ts-java-angular-jhipster](https://github.com/codev-workshops/ts-java-angular-jhipster) — Angular + Spring Boot JHipster monolith (alternative)
- **Objective:** Build a complete new feature — backend API, database schema, frontend UI, and tests — following existing codebase conventions

#### Step 1: Start with Ask Devin (recommended)

Before creating a session, try using **Ask Devin** to scope the feature:
- *"What existing patterns does timesheet-app use for CRUD features? What data model, API structure, and React component conventions should a new feature follow?"*
- *"What database migration approach does the app use? How are new tables created?"*

Then use what you learn to refine the prompt before pasting it into a Devin session:

#### Step 2: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

**Option A — React + Node.js (timesheet-app):**
```
Add a "Projects" management feature to timesheet-app. Users should be able to create, view, edit, and delete projects. Each project has a name, description, client assignment, start date, and status (active/completed/on-hold). Add both the backend API endpoints and the frontend UI page. Follow the existing patterns in the codebase for the data model, API structure, and React components. Write tests for the backend endpoints.
```

**Option B — Angular + Spring Boot (JHipster):**
```
Add an "Invoice" management feature to ts-java-angular-jhipster. Users should be able to create, view, edit, and delete invoices. Each invoice has a number, date, due date, amount, status (draft/sent/paid/overdue), and is linked to a bank account. Add both the Spring Boot backend (JPA entity, REST controller, service layer) and the Angular frontend (list view, create/edit form, detail view). Follow JHipster conventions for entity generation patterns. Write JUnit tests for the backend.
```

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the existing feature patterns. Use what you learn to try different approaches:
- Have Devin add **validation rules** for the new feature (e.g., project dates must not overlap, invoice amounts must be positive)
- Ask Devin to add **frontend tests** (React Testing Library or Angular TestBed) for the new UI components
- Try having Devin add **audit logging** for all CRUD operations
- Ask Devin to generate **API documentation** (Swagger/OpenAPI) for the new endpoints

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR & Observe PR Review Agent

Once Devin opens a PR from step 2, this is where the **PR Review feedback loop** comes in:
- **PR Review will automatically analyze the PR** and flag potential issues — missing validation, error handling gaps, security concerns, or logic bugs
- **Read the PR Review comments carefully** — they often catch real issues
- **Leave your own feedback** alongside the PR Review comments:
  - *"PR Review flagged that the project name field has no length validation — please add max length checking"*
  - *"Add error handling for the case where a client is deleted while it has active projects"*
  - *"The React component doesn't handle loading states — add a spinner while the API call is in flight"*

See the full challenge details for [New Feature Development](../../../../labs/application-development/new-feature-development.md) for more ideas.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Devin follows existing patterns"** — it analyzes the codebase's conventions before implementing, producing code that fits the existing architecture
  - **"PR Review catches what humans miss"** — the automated review agent flags validation gaps, error handling issues, and potential bugs before you even look at the PR
  - **"The feedback loop is the workflow"** — Devin writes, PR Review flags, you comment, Devin fixes. This is how teams use Devin in production every day
  - **"Knowledge compounds over time"** — if Devin discovers project conventions during this session, save them as Knowledge items. Future sessions will automatically benefit

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - New feature implemented following existing code conventions
  - Unit tests and/or integration tests for the new feature
  - Database schema changes with migration scripts
  - Frontend UI components for the new feature
  - PR Review comments identifying potential issues
  - Devin's responses to both PR Review and human feedback

### Lab A2 — API Feature with TDD

- **Module:** [Test-Driven Development](../../../../labs/application-development/test-driven-development.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction) — Spring Boot 2.6.3 RealWorld app with JUnit infrastructure
  - [uc-bdd-test-generation-cucumber](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-bdd-test-generation-cucumber) — Spring Boot + Cucumber BDD framework (alternative)
- **Objective:** Implement a new API feature using test-driven development — write failing tests first, then implement until they pass

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

**Option A — TDD with JUnit (Spring Boot RealWorld):**
```
Using test-driven development, add an "article statistics" feature to uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction. First, write failing JUnit tests for two new endpoints: GET /api/articles/:slug/stats (returns view count, favorite count, comment count, days since published) and GET /api/stats/trending (returns top 10 most-favorited articles in the last 7 days). Then implement the endpoints to make the tests pass. Follow existing code patterns. showing the TDD progression (tests written first, then implementation).
```

**Option B — BDD-First (Cucumber):**
```
Using behavior-driven development, add an order management feature to uc-bdd-test-generation-cucumber. First, write Gherkin feature files describing the behavior: create an order, list orders, get order by ID, update order status, delete order. Then implement an OrderController, OrderService, and Order entity to make all scenarios pass. Follow existing project patterns for step definitions and entity structure.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What are the existing test patterns in uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction? How are controller tests structured?"*
- *"What's the difference between MockMvc tests and integration tests in this codebase? Which is more appropriate for API endpoint testing?"*
- *"How does the Cucumber framework in uc-bdd-test-generation-cucumber handle test data setup and teardown?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the test infrastructure. Try:
- Have Devin add **negative test cases** (invalid inputs, unauthorized access, not-found scenarios)
- Ask Devin to add **data-driven tests** using parameterized JUnit or Cucumber Scenario Outlines
- Try having Devin add **contract tests** that verify the API response shape

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Once Devin opens a PR, focus your review on **TDD discipline**:
- **Test-first evidence:** Can you see from the commit history that tests were written before implementation?
- **Test quality:** Are the tests checking real behavior or just trivially asserting?
- **Edge cases:** Does the implementation handle boundary conditions discovered during TDD?

**Leave a feedback comment** and watch Devin respond:
- *"Add a test for when the article slug doesn't exist — should return 404"*
- *"The trending endpoint should handle the case where there are fewer than 10 articles"*
- *"Add an integration test that verifies the database query performance"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Tests-first produces better APIs"** — writing tests before code forces you to think about the API contract from the consumer's perspective
  - **"Devin demonstrates TDD discipline"** — the commit history shows tests written first, then implementation, making the process visible to reviewers
  - **"BDD bridges dev and business"** — Gherkin scenarios are readable by non-developers, making test suites a communication tool
  - **"Refactoring safety net"** — the tests written during TDD serve as a safety net for future refactoring

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Failing tests written before implementation
  - All tests passing after implementation
  - Clear TDD commit progression visible in PR history
  - Edge case and negative test coverage
  - PR with TDD evidence and review iterations

### Lab A3 — Requirements to Implementation

- **Modules:** [Gather Requirements](../../../../labs/application-development/gather-requirements.md) + [New Feature Development](../../../../labs/application-development/new-feature-development.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app) — React + Node.js full-stack application
  - [uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization) — Spring Boot loan management service (alternative)
- **Objective:** Start from vague business requirements, use Ask Devin to refine them into technical specifications, then have Devin implement the feature — demonstrating the full requirements-to-code pipeline

#### Step 1: Start with Ask Devin (required for this lab)

This lab starts with requirements gathering. Open **Ask Devin** and work through these prompts to build up a specification:

1. *"A manager wants to see which team members are overloaded this week. What data does timesheet-app already have that could power a 'team workload' dashboard? What's missing?"*
2. *"Based on the existing data model, design a 'Team Workload Dashboard' feature. What API endpoints are needed? What calculations should the backend perform? What should the UI show?"*
3. *"Write a detailed technical specification for the workload dashboard — include the data model, API contract (request/response shapes), and UI wireframe description."*

#### Step 2: Paste into Devin (using the refined spec from step 1)

Take the technical specification from Ask Devin and paste it into a new Devin session:

```
Implement the following feature for timesheet-app based on this specification:

[Paste the technical spec from Ask Devin here]

Follow existing code patterns. Add backend API endpoints, frontend React components, and tests.
```

Alternatively, if you want to try a less-refined approach:

```
A manager wants a "Team Workload Dashboard" in timesheet-app. They should be able to see: which team members have logged the most hours this week, who has upcoming deadlines, and which clients have the most active work entries. Figure out the best way to implement this given the existing data model and codebase patterns. Add backend calculations, an API endpoint, and a frontend dashboard page.
```

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the data model. Compare what Ask Devin suggested with what's actually available in the database.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Focus your review on whether the implementation matches the requirements:
- **Requirements fit:** Does the feature solve the manager's original problem?
- **Data accuracy:** Are the workload calculations correct?
- **UX quality:** Is the dashboard useful and intuitive?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"Add a date range picker so managers can look at workload for different weeks"*
- *"The overload threshold should be configurable, not hard-coded at 40 hours"*
- *"Add a CSV export for the workload summary"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Ask Devin for requirements → Session for implementation"** — the two-step workflow produces better results than jumping straight into code
  - **"Vague requirements still work"** — Devin can infer reasonable implementations from business-level descriptions, but refined specs produce better output
  - **"The spec is a living document"** — PR review feedback refines the feature iteratively, just like real product development
  - **"DeepWiki validates feasibility"** — checking the data model before implementation catches impossible requirements early

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Technical specification produced via Ask Devin
  - Feature implemented matching the specification
  - Backend API with calculations and frontend dashboard
  - Tests verifying the feature logic
  - PR with implementation and review iterations

## Track B: Bug Fixing & Root Cause Analysis

Track B demonstrates Devin as a debugger and investigator. Participants will hunt for bugs in running applications, trace issues across service boundaries, and fix data-related bugs with proper root cause analysis.

### Lab B1 — Exploratory Bug Hunting

- **Module:** [Fix Runtime Bug](../../../../labs/application-development/fix-runtime-bug.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app) — React + Node.js full-stack application
  - [calcom](https://github.com/codev-workshops/calcom) — Open-source scheduling platform (alternative, more complex)
- **Objective:** Start a running application, explore it to find bugs or unexpected behavior, then have Devin fix what it finds — demonstrating exploratory testing and debugging

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

```
Start timesheet-app locally (backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`, frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`). Explore the application — create work entries, manage clients, try the reporting features, test edge cases (empty inputs, special characters, date boundaries, concurrent operations). Find and document any bugs or unexpected behavior. Fix the most impactful bug you find. Take before/after screenshots. Write a `ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md` explaining the bug, why it happened, and how you fixed it.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What are the most common types of bugs in Express + React applications? What should I look for?"*
- *"What error handling patterns does timesheet-app use? Are there any gaps?"*
- *"What edge cases are most likely to have bugs — date handling, number formatting, empty states, concurrent access?"*
- Use the analysis to start a **second session** targeting a different area of the application

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the application architecture:
- Identify components that might have bugs (complex state management, API error handling, date/time logic)
- Look at the data flow from frontend form submission to database write
- Find areas with minimal test coverage — bugs are more likely here

Try different approaches:
- Have Devin add a **regression test** for any bug it finds
- Ask Devin to check for **similar bugs** elsewhere in the codebase
- Try having Devin produce a **debugging narrative** that traces the issue from symptom to root cause

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Once Devin opens a PR, focus your review on the **root cause analysis**:
- **Root cause:** Does the analysis explain *why* the bug happened, not just *what* was changed?
- **Fix quality:** Does the fix address the root cause or just the symptom?
- **Regression prevention:** Is there a test that will catch this bug if it's reintroduced?

**Leave a feedback comment** and watch Devin respond:
- *"Add a regression test for this bug"*
- *"Are there any other places in the codebase that make the same assumption?"*
- *"The fix handles the immediate case but what happens if the input is null?"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Devin debugs like a developer"** — it reproduces bugs via the browser, traces data flows, reads logs, and identifies root causes
  - **"Exploratory testing finds real bugs"** — Devin tests edge cases and workflows that unit tests miss
  - **"Screen recordings as evidence"** — Devin's before/after screenshots provide visual proof that the fix works
  - **"Root cause analysis prevents recurrence"** — understanding *why* a bug happened is more valuable than just fixing it

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Bug identified with reproduction steps
  - Root cause analysis documented in `ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md`
  - Fix implemented with before/after evidence (screenshots or screen recording)
  - Regression test added
  - PR with fix explanation and Devin's responses to review comments

---

### Lab B2 — Cross-Service Bug Investigation

- **Module:** [Fix Runtime Bug](../../../../labs/application-development/fix-runtime-bug.md) + [Cross-Service Bug Investigation](../../../../labs/migration-modernization/cross-service-bug-investigation.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [quickapp-microservices](https://github.com/codev-workshops/quickapp-microservices) — decomposed .NET microservices with a planted cross-service bug
  - [eventflow-order-service](https://github.com/codev-workshops/eventflow-order-service) + [eventflow-payment-service](https://github.com/codev-workshops/eventflow-payment-service) — EventFlow multi-service application (alternative)
- **Objective:** Investigate a bug that manifests in one service but has its root cause in another — demonstrating Devin's ability to trace issues across service boundaries

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

**Option A — .NET Microservices (notification amount bug):**
```
Order confirmation notification emails are showing wrong amounts after the microservice decomposition. A $149.99 order shows as $1.50 in the email preview. Investigate and fix this bug in quickapp-microservices. To reproduce: run the notification-service locally, POST to `http://localhost:5005/api/notification/events/order-placed` with `{"orderId": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111", "customerId": "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222", "totalAmount": 149.99, "placedAt": "2026-03-17T12:00:00Z"}`, then open the preview URL — the total shows $1.50 instead of $149.99. Find the root cause, fix it, take before/after screenshots, and open a PR with your fix and root cause analysis.
```

**Option B — EventFlow (currency precision bug):**
```
The EventFlow payment service is incorrectly processing JPY (Japanese Yen) orders. JPY is a zero-decimal currency but the payment service is dividing by 100 like other currencies, resulting in incorrect amounts. Investigate the payment processing logic in eventflow-payment-service, identify where zero-decimal currency handling should be added, fix the bug, and add unit tests covering JPY, USD, and EUR.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"Trace the data flow from when an OrderPlacedEvent is received to when the notification email is rendered. Where does the monetary amount get transformed?"*
- *"What does the OrderPlacedEvent.TotalAmount field represent — dollars or cents? Check the shared contract definition."*
- *"What are zero-decimal currencies and which payment APIs handle them differently? How should JPY amounts be processed?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the event flow between services:
- Trace the data contract from Order service to Notification/Payment service
- Identify shared libraries and their assumptions about data formats
- Look for misleading comments that might be hiding the bug

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Focus your review on whether the fix is complete:
- **Root cause identified:** Is it a data format mismatch, unit conversion error, or shared contract issue?
- **Fix scope:** Does the fix only change the symptom service, or does it address the source of truth?
- **All affected paths:** Are there other services that might have the same bug?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"Are there any other notification types that format monetary amounts? Check those too."*
- *"Add a contract test that verifies both services agree on the amount format"*
- *"Add a unit test for FormatCurrency that verifies $149.99 renders as '$149.99' and not '$1.50'"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Cross-service tracing"** — Devin follows data across service boundaries and shared contracts to find root causes that live outside the symptom's service
  - **"Don't trust comments"** — the cross-service bug includes a misleading code comment. Devin learns to verify against the actual data contract
  - **"Shared contracts are the source of truth"** — when services disagree, the contract definition is authoritative
  - **"Contract tests prevent regression"** — adding tests that verify inter-service agreements catches future mismatches early

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Root cause identified across service boundaries
  - Fix applied to the correct service (source of the bug, not just the symptom)
  - Before/after screenshots or screen recording
  - Contract test or regression test added
  - PR with root cause analysis documenting the data flow

---

### Lab B3 — Data Bug & Schema Fix

- **Modules:** [Fix Data Bug](../../../../labs/application-development/fix-data-bug.md) + [Database Schema Evolution](../../../../labs/application-development/database-schema-evolution.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization) — Spring Boot loan service with legacy CDW-style tables
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app) — React + Node.js app with SQLite (alternative)
- **Objective:** Investigate and fix a data-related bug — incorrect query results, type conversion errors, or schema inconsistencies — and evolve the schema to prevent recurrence

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

**Option A — Legacy Data Types (loan service):**
```
The loan service in uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization is reading from legacy CDW-style tables where all columns are VARCHAR (including amounts, dates, and IDs). Some loan balance queries return incorrect results because string comparison is used instead of numeric comparison — for example, a loan with balance "99.50" appears as greater than one with balance "1000.00" because string sort puts "9" after "1". Identify all repository queries that compare or sort numeric VARCHAR fields. Fix the queries to properly cast to numeric types. Add JUnit tests that verify correct ordering and comparison. Document the fix in a `DATA_BUG_ANALYSIS.md`.
```

**Option B — SQLite Type Issues (timesheet app):**
```
Investigate the date handling in timesheet-app's backend. SQLite stores dates as text, which can cause issues with date range queries, sorting, and timezone handling. Find any bugs related to date storage or retrieval (e.g., work entries on boundary dates not appearing in reports, timezone-related off-by-one errors). Fix the issues and add tests that verify correct behavior across date boundaries.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What are the most common bugs when reading from all-VARCHAR legacy tables? How do type coercion issues manifest?"*
- *"What's the correct way to handle numeric comparison in JPA/JPQL when the underlying column is VARCHAR?"*
- *"What SQLite-specific date handling gotchas should I be aware of?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the data layer. Try:
- Have Devin add **database constraints** that prevent invalid data from being stored
- Ask Devin to create a **data validation migration** that checks existing data for type issues
- Try having Devin add **query-level assertions** that verify return types match expectations

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Focus your review on **data correctness**:
- **Query fix:** Are all numeric comparisons now using proper casting?
- **Migration safety:** Will the schema change work with existing data?
- **Test coverage:** Do tests cover the boundary conditions that triggered the original bug?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"What happens if a VARCHAR field contains non-numeric data like 'N/A'? Add error handling."*
- *"Add a test with the specific values that triggered the original bug"*
- *"Create a database migration that adds CHECK constraints to prevent future invalid data"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Data bugs are subtle"** — they produce wrong results without throwing errors, making them harder to detect than crashes
  - **"Legacy schemas require defensive coding"** — when the database doesn't enforce types, the application must
  - **"Schema evolution is part of the fix"** — fixing the query is necessary, but adding constraints prevents recurrence
  - **"Tests must use realistic data"** — test data that doesn't hit boundary conditions won't catch the bugs that matter

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Data bug identified with specific examples of incorrect behavior
  - Query or schema fix applied with proper type handling
  - `DATA_BUG_ANALYSIS.md` documenting the issue and fix
  - Tests with boundary-condition data proving the fix
  - PR with analysis and evidence

## Track C: Maintenance & Evolution

Track C demonstrates Devin as a maintenance engineer. Participants will set up automated dependency upgrades, evolve database schemas safely, and refactor tech debt — the ongoing work that keeps applications healthy over time.

### Lab C1 — Dependency Upgrades & Scheduled Maintenance

- **Modules:** [Upgrade Dependencies](../../../../labs/security/upgrade-dependencies.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance) — Spring Boot app with Gradle
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app) — Node.js app with npm (alternative)
- **Objective:** Upgrade dependencies to latest minor/patch versions, verify the build passes, and set up a recurring Devin Automation for automated weekly maintenance

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

```
Check all dependencies in uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance for available minor and patch version updates. Upgrade each dependency to the latest minor version (do not jump major versions). Run `./gradlew build` and `./gradlew test` to verify the build still passes after each upgrade. If any upgrade breaks the build, revert that specific upgrade and document it.md` listing what was upgraded, from which version to which version, and any upgrades that were skipped (with reasons). Title the PR "chore: weekly dependency version bump".
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What dependencies in uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance are the most out of date? Which ones have the most available minor/patch updates?"*
- *"What's the difference between minor and patch version upgrades in terms of risk? When is it safe to auto-upgrade vs. requiring human review?"*
- *"How should a team handle dependency upgrades that break the build — auto-revert and flag, or block and notify?"*
- Consider creating a **Devin Knowledge item** capturing the dependency upgrade policy

#### Step 3 (Optional): Set Up a Devin Automation

Once you're happy with the output from step 1, turn it into a recurring task using **Automations**. Navigate to the Automations page and use the pre-built **Weekly Dependency Updates** template, or create a custom Automation with a schedule trigger:

- **Trigger:** Schedule — weekly, Monday mornings
- **Action:** Start a new Devin session against `uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance`
- **Prompt:**

```
Check all dependencies for available minor and patch version
updates. Upgrade to the latest minor versions. Run the full
test suite and build to verify nothing is broken. If any
upgrade breaks the build, revert that specific upgrade and
note it in the PR description. Title the PR
"chore: weekly dependency version bump".
```

Automations support both schedule and event-driven triggers — you could also add a GitHub push trigger to run dependency checks on every merge to `main`.

Consider pairing this with **Security Swarm Auto Scan** on a recurring schedule. Security Swarm builds a threat model for the repo, scans for vulnerabilities (dependency-related and beyond), and surfaces validated findings — a natural complement to dependency upgrades as part of your ongoing maintenance cadence.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Extend to Multiple Repos

Try running the same pattern for **timesheet-app** with an npm-flavored prompt:

```
Check all npm dependencies in timesheet-app for available minor and patch version updates. Run `npm update` to upgrade to latest minor versions. Run `npm test` and `npm run build` to verify everything still works.md`.
```

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Automate the boring stuff"** — dependency upgrades are repetitive, low-risk, and high-volume. Devin handles them weekly without human intervention
  - **"Automations = always-on maintenance"** — set up a Devin Automation with a schedule trigger once, and Devin executes on a cadence. Pre-built templates like *Weekly Dependency Updates* make setup even faster
  - **"Security Swarm complements upgrades"** — dependency updates fix known CVEs, but Security Swarm catches vulnerabilities in your own code (injection, authorization bypasses, path traversal) that no dependency bump will fix
  - **"Safe by default"** — the prompt instructs Devin to verify builds, revert breaking upgrades, and document everything. The PR still requires human approval
  - **"Scales across repos and tech stacks"** — the same pattern works for Gradle, npm, pip, cargo, etc. Use Managed Devins to run the same upgrade across multiple repos in parallel

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Devin Automation configured for weekly dependency upgrades (schedule trigger)
  - PR with dependency upgrades and `DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md`
  - Knowledge item capturing the team's dependency upgrade policy
  - Same Automation replicated across multiple repos/tech stacks

### Lab C2 — Database Schema Evolution

- **Module:** [Database Schema Evolution](../../../../labs/application-development/database-schema-evolution.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction) — Spring Boot with Flyway migrations and SQLite
  - [ts-java-angular-jhipster](https://github.com/codev-workshops/ts-java-angular-jhipster) — JHipster app with Liquibase (alternative)
- **Objective:** Evolve a database schema safely — add new tables, modify existing columns, migrate data, and ensure backward compatibility with the application layer

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

**Option A — Flyway Migrations (Spring Boot):**
```
Evolve the database schema of uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction to support article tags as a first-class entity. Currently tags are stored as strings in the articles table. Create Flyway migration scripts that: (1) Create a new `tags` table with id and name columns, (2) Create a junction table `article_tags` for the many-to-many relationship, (3) Migrate existing tag data from the articles table to the new structure, (4) Update the MyBatis mappers and Java domain model to use the new schema. Ensure existing tests still pass and write new tests for the tag CRUD operations.
```

**Option B — Liquibase Changesets (JHipster):**
```
Add a "transaction categories" feature to ts-java-angular-jhipster. Create Liquibase changesets that: (1) Add a `category` table with id, name, color, icon, and user_id, (2) Add a category_id foreign key to the operation table, (3) Create seed data with default categories (Income, Groceries, Transport, Entertainment). Update the JPA entities, Spring Data repositories, and REST controllers to support CRUD on categories and category assignment to operations.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What's the current database schema? What tables and relationships exist?"*
- *"What's the safest way to add a foreign key to an existing table with data — should we use a nullable FK first?"*
- *"What are the best practices for data migration scripts — how do we handle failures and rollbacks?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page. Try:
- Have Devin add a **rollback migration** that reverses the schema change
- Ask Devin to add **database-level constraints** (CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL) with appropriate handling
- Try having Devin create a **schema documentation** file showing the current ERD

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Focus on **migration safety**:
- **Ordering:** Are migrations numbered correctly and idempotent?
- **Data preservation:** Does the data migration handle edge cases (null tags, duplicate tags)?
- **Backward compatibility:** Would the old application code still work during the migration window?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"What happens if the migration fails halfway through? Add transaction boundaries."*
- *"The data migration should handle articles with no tags — verify with a test"*
- *"Add an index on the junction table for query performance"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Schema changes require migrations, not DDL"** — Devin creates proper versioned migration scripts, not ad-hoc SQL
  - **"Data migration is part of schema evolution"** — restructuring a column means migrating existing data, not just changing the DDL
  - **"Tests verify the full path"** — both the migration script and the application code must work together
  - **"Backward compatibility matters"** — in production, zero-downtime deployments require migrations that work with both old and new application versions

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Versioned migration scripts (Flyway or Liquibase)
  - Data migration handling existing records
  - Updated domain model and repository layer
  - Tests verifying both migration and application behavior
  - PR with migration scripts and updated application code

### Lab C3 — Code Refactoring & Tech Debt

- **Module:** [Code Refactoring & Tech Debt](../../../../labs/architecture-design/code-refactoring-tech-debt.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/codev-workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction) — Spring Boot monolith with identifiable tech debt
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/codev-workshops/timesheet-app) — React + Node.js app (alternative)
- **Objective:** Identify and refactor tech debt in an existing codebase — extract methods, improve naming, reduce duplication, and improve testability — while preserving behavior

#### Step 1: Paste into Devin (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

**Option A — Spring Boot Refactoring:**
```
Analyze uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction for code quality issues. Focus on the Articles domain: identify long methods, duplicated code, unclear naming, missing error handling, and tight coupling. Refactor the top 5 most impactful issues. For each refactoring: (1) explain what the problem was, (2) describe the refactoring approach, (3) verify existing tests still pass after the change. Document all changes in a `REFACTORING_LOG.md`.
```

**Option B — React/Node.js Refactoring:**
```
Analyze timesheet-app for code quality issues. Focus on: duplicated API call patterns that could use a shared utility, React components that are too large (> 200 lines) that should be split, inconsistent error handling across API routes, and any remaining TODO comments in the code. Refactor the top 5 most impactful issues while keeping all existing behavior intact. Run tests to verify nothing broke. Document changes in a `REFACTORING_LOG.md`.
```

#### Step 2: Research with Ask Devin

While Devin works on step 1, open **AskDevin** and explore:
- *"What are the most common code smells in this codebase? Which files have the highest complexity?"*
- *"What refactoring patterns are most applicable — Extract Method, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Introduce Parameter Object?"*
- *"Which refactorings are safest to do without comprehensive test coverage?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page. Try:
- Have Devin add **tests before refactoring** (characterization tests) to ensure behavior preservation
- Ask Devin to measure **cyclomatic complexity** before and after refactoring
- Try having Devin produce a **dependency graph** showing coupling between modules

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review & Give Feedback

Focus on **behavior preservation**:
- **Same behavior:** Do all existing tests still pass?
- **Meaningful improvement:** Does the refactoring make the code genuinely more maintainable?
- **Right scope:** Was each refactoring small enough to be easily reviewed?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"Can you split this into separate commits — one refactoring per commit?"*
- *"This extracted method should be tested independently"*
- *"The naming improvement is good but let's also add a brief doc comment explaining the business logic"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Refactoring preserves behavior"** — every change must pass existing tests. No new functionality, just improved structure
  - **"Small, atomic changes"** — each refactoring should be reviewable in isolation. Devin commits them separately
  - **"Tech debt compounds"** — small improvements over time prevent the codebase from becoming unmaintainable
  - **"Documentation captures intent"** — the `REFACTORING_LOG.md` explains *why* each change was made, helping future developers

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - 5+ refactorings applied with tests still passing
  - `REFACTORING_LOG.md` documenting each change and rationale
  - Measurable improvement (reduced complexity, fewer duplications)
  - Separate commits for each refactoring (reviewable individually)
  - PR with refactoring evidence and review iterations
