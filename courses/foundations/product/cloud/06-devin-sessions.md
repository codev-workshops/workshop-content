## What a Session Is

A Devin session is the fundamental unit of work. When you give Devin a task, a session is created: an isolated Linux VM boots, the agent begins working, and it continues until the task is complete or it needs your input.

Think of a session as assigning a task to a team member who has their own workstation:
- They have their own machine (isolated VM)
- They have access to your repos, tools, and integrations (shared context layer)
- They work independently until they deliver output or need help
- They keep notes on what they did (session timeline)
- When they're done, they hand you the result (PR, report, or artifact)

Each session is isolated from every other session — separate filesystem, separate processes, separate branch. This means:
- Sessions cannot interfere with each other
- Failures in one session don't affect others
- Multiple sessions can run in parallel safely
- Each session's work is independently reviewable

**Created:** Session initialized, VM booting, environment loading.

**Active:** Agent is executing — reading code, running commands, making edits, pushing commits. This is the phase that consumes compute (ACUs).

**Waiting/Hibernated:** Agent has delivered output (opened a PR, asked a question) and is waiting for input. The VM state is snapshot and compute is released. No cost during hibernation.

**Resumed:** New input arrives (PR comment, user message, CI result) and the VM restores from snapshot. Agent picks up exactly where it left off with full context.

**Completed:** Task is finished. The session becomes a read-only record — timeline, artifacts, and learnings are preserved.

### The Hibernation Model

Hibernation is what makes the economics work. The agent doesn't sit idle burning compute while you review a PR or think about feedback. It snapshots its state and releases resources. When you're ready to interact, it resumes in seconds with zero context loss.

This means:
- Long-running tasks (multi-day code reviews) are natural and cost-efficient — cycles of back-and-forth review are how real engineering works, and hibernation makes each cycle free while the human side thinks
- The asynchronous nature means you respond to the agent when you want and context is not lost
- Multiple sessions can be in flight simultaneously, each with different context scopes and independent working dev environments

<a id="starting-a-session"></a>
## Starting a Session

Sessions can be started from multiple surfaces:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Web app** (app.devin.ai) | Full-featured prompt composition with repo selection |
| **Slack / Teams** | Quick tasks from a conversation thread |
| **IDE delegation** | Handing off from local work to cloud execution |
| **CLI** (`devin` command) | Terminal-native workflows that eventually need a cloud handoff for long-cycle execution |
| **API** (`POST /sessions`) | Programmatic triggering from CI, scripts, or orchestration |
| **Automations** | Event-driven (webhooks, schedules, issue assignment) |
| **Linear / Jira** | Assign a ticket directly to Devin |

The prompt you provide at session start is the agent's initial instruction. The quality of this prompt significantly impacts the quality of the output (see [What to Give AI](../../concepts/04-what-to-give-ai.md)).

<a id="the-session-interface"></a>
## The Session Interface

Once a session is running, you can observe and interact through the web app:

### Session Timeline
A chronological record of every action the agent takes:
- File edits (with diffs)
- Shell commands (with output)
- Browser interactions (with screenshots)
- Decision points (reasoning about approach)
- Errors encountered and how they were resolved

The timeline is your audit trail. After the session completes, you can review exactly what happened — useful for building trust, debugging unexpected output, or understanding the agent's reasoning.

### Desktop View
A live view of the agent's VM desktop. You can:
- Watch it work in real time (though this is usually not the best use of your time)
- Take manual control if needed
- Verify visual output (UI testing, browser-based interactions)

### Chat Interface
Send messages to the agent during the session:
- Provide additional context ("also check the config in `ops/` directory")
- Redirect approach ("don't use library X, use Y instead")
- Answer questions the agent asks

### Session Insights
Post-session analytics:
- ACU usage (how much compute was consumed)
- Timeline breakdown (time spent on each phase)
- Activity summary (files edited, commands run, commits pushed)

<a id="context-that-flows-in"></a>
## Context That Flows In

Every session automatically receives context from the organization's shared layer:

| Context Source | What It Provides |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Environment Blueprint** | Pre-built VM with dependencies and tools installed, plus knowledge and context scoped at the repo, org, or enterprise level — sessions boot ready to build |
| **Knowledge Notes** | Team conventions, coding standards, architecture decisions — retrieved based on task relevance |
| **Secrets** | API keys, tokens, credentials — injected into the environment securely |
| **Git Connections** | Repository access — agent can clone and push immediately |
| **MCP Servers** | Integrations (Jira, Datadog, etc.) — agent can query external tools |
| **AGENTS.md** | Repo-specific instructions — always-on rules for that codebase |
| **DeepWiki** | Architectural documentation — agent understands the system before acting |

This shared context layer means that configuring Devin is a one-time investment. Once set up, every session — from any team member — inherits the same configuration. No per-session setup required.

<a id="outputs-and-artifacts"></a>
## Outputs and Artifacts

What a session produces depends on the task:

| Output Type | When |
|-------------|------|
| **Pull Request** | Code changes — the most common output |
| **Report** | Analysis, research, or investigation findings |
| **Deployed Artifact** | Infrastructure changes, environment setup |
| **Conversation** | Answers to questions (Ask Devin mode) |
| **Status Update** | Progress on long-running tasks |

For code changes, the PR is the primary deliverable. It includes:
- A description explaining what was done and why
- The diff itself (reviewable in your git provider)
- CI results (the agent monitors and fixes failures before requesting review)
- A link back to the session for full context

## Devin Review

Devin Review is a proactive code review capability that analyzes new pull requests for bugs, security issues, and quality problems.

**Capabilities:**
- **Bug detection** — Finds logic errors, null pointer risks, race conditions, and edge cases in new diffs
- **PR digestion** — Summarizes large PRs into readable overviews, highlighting the most important changes and potential risks
- **Proactive remediation** — When Devin Review finds a bug, it can automatically open a fix PR rather than just commenting
- **Configurable rules** — Teams customize what Devin Review checks for, adjusting sensitivity and focus areas

**Workflow integration:**
- Devin Review runs automatically on new PRs (configurable per repo or org)
- Findings appear as PR comments, indistinguishable from human review feedback
- Developers respond to Devin Review comments just as they would to any reviewer
- Critical findings can block merge via required status checks

Devin Review complements human review — it catches mechanical issues (logic bugs, security risks, missing edge cases) so human reviewers can focus on design, architecture, and intent.

<a id="session-economics"></a>
## Session Economics

Sessions consume ACUs (Agent Compute Units) during active work:

- **Active execution** — costs ACUs (agent running, building, testing)
- **Hibernation** — costs nothing (VM snapshot stored, compute released)
- **Human review time** — costs nothing (the clock stops when the agent waits)

This consumption model means:
- Short, focused tasks are inexpensive
- Long sessions with lots of human review time are still economical (hibernation periods are free)
- Failed attempts cost ACUs — clear prompts reduce wasted compute
- Child sessions (parallel work) multiply throughput but also multiply ACU consumption proportionally

Organizations set ACU budgets at the org, team, or user level. Budgets provide cost governance without limiting what the agent can accomplish within its allocation.

## The Continuous Improvement Cycle

Devin's effectiveness compounds over time as the team invests in the shared context layer:

```
Initial Setup
    ├── Connect repos (Git connections)
    ├── Configure environment (VM blueprints with runtimes, tools)
    ├── Add knowledge notes (standards, conventions, domain glossary)
    ├── Provision secrets (API keys, service account credentials)
    └── Set up MCP servers (Jira, Datadog, Confluence, etc.)
        ↓
First Sessions
    ├── Devin learns the codebase through context retrieval
    ├── Team refines prompts based on results
    └── Playbooks are created for recurring tasks
        ↓
Mature Operation
    ├── Scheduled sessions handle routine maintenance automatically
    ├── Event-driven triggers respond to incidents and findings
    ├── Playbooks encode institutional knowledge for consistent execution
    └── Child agents parallelize large-scale campaigns
        ↓
Compounding Value
    ├── Less manual maintenance overhead → engineers focus on architecture and product
    ├── Faster incident response → reduced MTTR
    ├── Consistent quality enforcement → fewer regressions
    └── Scalable capacity → handle work surges without hiring
```

Each phase builds on the previous one. The upfront investment in configuration pays dividends across every subsequent session — and the returns grow as playbooks mature and knowledge notes accumulate.

<a id="exploration-activity"></a>
## Exploration Activity

**Try this:** Open the Devin web app and browse recent sessions (yours or shared ones). For each session, notice:

1. **How it started** — what prompt was given, which surface was used
2. **The timeline** — how many steps the agent took, what tools it used, how it handled errors
3. **The lifecycle** — did it complete in one shot, or did it hibernate and resume?
4. **The output** — what was delivered (PR, report, etc.)
5. **The ACU cost** — check Session Insights for how much compute was consumed

Try starting a lightweight session yourself: use Ask Devin to ask a question about one of your team's repos. This creates a session without code changes — a low-commitment way to see the mechanics in action.
