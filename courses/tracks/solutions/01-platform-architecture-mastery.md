This section covers what you must know cold when fielding client questions about how Devin works, where their data goes, and how security is maintained.

## 1.1 Clean-Room Execution Model

Every Devin session runs on its own isolated virtual machine. This is not a container sharing a kernel with other workloads — it is a full Linux VM with:

- **No lateral movement** — sessions cannot access other sessions' resources, data, or credentials
- **Ephemeral by default** — the VM is destroyed after the session completes; no persistent state leaks between tasks
- **Reproducible from scratch** — every session boots from the same base image (configured via environment blueprints), eliminating environment drift
- **Service account identity** — Devin authenticates using scoped credentials provisioned by the organization, not individual user tokens

**What clients ask:**
- *"Where does our code go?"* → Cloned onto the session VM, processed in isolation, pushed back via Git. The VM is ephemeral.
- *"Can one session access another session's data?"* → No. Each session has its own VM, its own filesystem, its own network namespace.
- *"What about secrets?"* → Injected at session start via the platform's secrets management layer. Never embedded in prompts, logs, or code.

## 1.2 The Shared Context Layer

While each session's runtime is isolated, Devin does not start from scratch. A persistent configuration layer flows into every session:

| Component | What It Provides | Configured By |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Environment blueprints** | Pre-built VM images with dependencies, runtimes, tools, and startup scripts | Platform team (once) |
| **Knowledge notes** | Persistent context — coding standards, architecture decisions, domain glossary — retrieved automatically based on task relevance | Engineers (iteratively) |
| **DeepWiki** | Auto-generated architectural documentation for indexed repositories — gives Devin codebase understanding (structure, patterns, dependencies) before it reads a single file | Automatic (indexed on connection) |
| **Playbooks** | Repeatable step-by-step procedures encoding institutional methodology | Senior engineers / architects |
| **MCP servers** | Pre-configured integrations (Jira, Datadog, Confluence, Azure DevOps) available to every session | Platform team (once) |
| **Secrets** | Scoped credentials (API keys, service account tokens) injected at session start | Security / platform team |
| **Git connections** | Repository access configured at the org level — every session can clone and push immediately | Admin (once) |

**The design insight:** This gives you both **clean-room isolation for security** and a **shared context layer for productivity**. Each worker VM is sandboxed, but the organization's accumulated knowledge and configuration flow in automatically.

## 1.3 Context Retrieval

Devin retrieves context programmatically before acting — it pulls from indexed codebases, configured integrations, and remote resources rather than relying on assumptions:

| Source | How Devin Uses It |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Git repositories** | Clones repos, reads code, understands project structure, examines history |
| **DeepWiki** | Auto-generated architectural documentation for any indexed repo — Devin reads this to understand systems it has never seen before |
| **MCP servers** | Model Context Protocol lets Devin call external tools as if they were local: query Jira tickets, read Datadog logs, search Confluence, browse Azure DevOps boards |
| **Shell access** | Devin has a full Linux shell — `curl` APIs, query databases, run CLI tools, install packages, execute arbitrary commands |
| **Browser** | Navigate web pages, interact with UIs, extract information from web-based tools |
| **Knowledge notes** | Persistent, human-curated context (coding standards, architecture decisions, team conventions) retrieved automatically based on the task |

**Client implication:** Devin does not guess — it reads. For every task, it retrieves relevant context from the configured sources before writing a single line of code. This is why the shared context layer (section 1.2) matters: the richer the configured context, the better the agent's first-pass output.

## 1.4 Session Lifecycle

Sessions move through a deliberate lifecycle optimized for efficiency:

```
Active → Waiting for Feedback → Hibernated → Resumed
```

| State | What Happens | Compute Cost |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Active** | Devin executes tasks, runs builds, writes code | Full |
| **Waiting for feedback** | PR opened or question asked; monitoring for comments and CI results | Minimal |
| **Hibernated** | VM state snapshotted, compute released after inactivity | None |
| **Resumed** | New feedback arrives (PR comment, CI result, user message); VM restored from snapshot with full context | Full |

**Why this matters for clients:**
- Sessions do not waste compute while waiting for human review
- Multi-day iterations (back-and-forth PR reviews, blocked dependencies) are natural — context is preserved across the full task lifecycle
- Cost is proportional to active work time, not wall-clock time

## 1.5 The Verification Model

Devin verifies its own work through a layered approach:

1. **Local testing** — Unit tests, integration tests, linting, and type checking run on the session VM before opening a PR
2. **CI monitoring** — After pushing, Devin watches CI checks, reads failure logs, diagnoses issues, pushes fixes, and re-checks — up to multiple iterations
3. **PR as the review gate** — Devin never merges its own work. The PR is the handoff point where humans (or Devin Review) inspect the diff
4. **External system validation** — Devin connects to staging environments, external test systems, or cloud services to validate integration-level outcomes

**Client implication:** The merge decision is always human. Devin proposes; humans approve. This fits existing governance and compliance models without modification.

## 1.6 Team Integration

Devin operates as a team member within existing workflows:

- **Organizational configuration** — One engineer configures the shared context layer; every subsequent session benefits
- **PR-based communication** — Multiple team members comment on the same Devin PR; Devin reads and responds to feedback from any reviewer
- **Session continuity** — Context is preserved across hibernation/resume cycles. No re-reading from scratch when feedback arrives
- **Audit trail** — Every session has a complete log of actions, decisions, and outputs

## Knowledge Checks

**Knowledge Check 1.1**
Q: A client asks: "How does Devin understand our codebase if it has never seen it before?" How do you respond?
A) "Devin reads every file from top to bottom before starting"
B) "Devin consults DeepWiki for architectural understanding, retrieves Knowledge notes for team conventions, queries MCP integrations for external context, and reads specific code files relevant to the task"
C) "Devin relies on the prompt to contain all necessary context"
D) "Devin only works with codebases it has seen before"
*Answer: B — Devin retrieves context from multiple sources programmatically. DeepWiki provides structural understanding, Knowledge notes provide cultural understanding, MCP integrations provide external tool context, and direct code reading fills in the details. The richer the configured context, the better the output.*

**Knowledge Check 1.2**
Q: A client asks: "If Devin has access to our production database credentials, could a session accidentally leak those credentials to another project?" How do you respond?
A) "Credentials are shared across sessions for efficiency"
B) "Each session runs in an isolated VM with scoped secrets — credentials injected into one session are not accessible to any other session"
C) "We encrypt credentials at rest, so they cannot be leaked"
D) "Devin does not support database access"
*Answer: B — The clean-room execution model ensures each session has its own isolated VM. Secrets are injected per-session through the platform's secrets management layer, scoped to the resources that session needs.*

**Knowledge Check 1.3**
Q: A client has 20 engineers. They are concerned about configuration overhead — does each engineer need to set up Devin independently?
A) "Yes, each engineer configures their own Devin environment"
B) "No — the shared context layer (blueprints, Knowledge, Playbooks, MCP, Secrets, Git connections) is configured once at the org level and flows into every session from any team member"
C) "Only the first engineer needs to configure it, then they share their credentials"
D) "Devin requires no configuration"
*Answer: B — The shared context layer is the key design insight. One engineer invests in configuration; every subsequent session — from any team member — inherits it automatically.*

**Knowledge Check 1.4**
Q: What happens when a Devin session opens a PR and waits 3 days for human review?
A) "The session times out and is lost"
B) "The session continues consuming compute while waiting"
C) "The session hibernates (releasing compute), then resumes with full context when feedback arrives"
D) "A new session must be started to address review comments"
*Answer: C — The hibernation/resume lifecycle means sessions do not waste compute while waiting. When new feedback arrives (PR comment, CI result, user message), the VM is restored from its snapshot with full context preserved.*

**Knowledge Check 1.5**
Q: In Devin's verification model, who makes the merge decision?
A) "Devin merges automatically when CI passes"
B) "The session creator merges"
C) "A human always makes the merge decision — Devin proposes via PR, humans approve"
D) "Devin Review merges if it finds no issues"
*Answer: C — Devin never merges its own work. The PR is the review gate where humans inspect the diff and decide whether to merge. This preserves existing governance models.*

## Key Takeaways

- **Clean-room isolation + shared context** is the core architectural insight: security through VM isolation, productivity through persistent configuration
- **Sessions are ephemeral; knowledge is persistent** — the VM is destroyed after use, but the organization's context layer grows over time
- **The session lifecycle optimizes for cost** — hibernation releases compute while preserving context; cost tracks active work, not wall-clock time
- **Context retrieval is programmatic** — Devin reads from Git repos, DeepWiki, MCP integrations, shell, browser, and Knowledge notes before acting; the richer the configuration, the better the output
- **Verification is layered** — local tests → CI monitoring → PR gate → external validation; the merge decision is always human
