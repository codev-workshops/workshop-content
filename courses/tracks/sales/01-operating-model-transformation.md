# Operating Model Transformation

How the human + agent delivery model changes staffing models, bench economics, and margin.

## The Three-Tier Work Distribution Model

In a human + agent delivery organization, work distributes across three tiers — each optimized for what it does best:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              HUMAN ENGINEERS (Judgment Tier)                 │
│                                                             │
│  • Architecture and system design decisions                 │
│  • Novel problem-solving requiring creativity               │
│  • Stakeholder communication and political navigation       │
│  • Code review, approval, and quality gates                 │
│  • Exception handling when agents escalate                  │
│  • Engagement oversight and orchestration decisions         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↕ PR review, feedback, approval
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              CLOUD AGENTS (Execution Tier)                   │
│                                                             │
│  • Implementation of well-defined tasks at scale            │
│  • Repetitive work parallelized across targets              │
│  • Event-driven responses (CI fixes, security triage)       │
│  • Scheduled maintenance (dependency bumps, docs refresh)   │
│  • Investigation, diagnosis, and remediation                │
│  • Test generation and coverage expansion                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↕ Real-time assistance in the editor
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              LOCAL AGENTS (Acceleration Tier)                │
│                                                             │
│  • Code completion and generation in the IDE                │
│  • Real-time pair programming during active development     │
│  • Quick refactors within active focus                      │
│  • Inline explanations and documentation                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The **Judgment Tier** is where human engineers are irreplaceable — architecture decisions, creative design, political navigation, and final approval authority. This is the work that justifies senior billing rates.

The **Execution Tier** is where cloud agents produce the most leverage — high-volume, well-defined tasks that can be parallelized and verified programmatically. This is the work that traditionally required large teams of mid-level engineers.

The **Acceleration Tier** is where local AI assistants speed up individual engineers during their active development — code completion, quick refactors, and inline help. This improves individual productivity but does not change staffing models.

## How Sprint Planning Changes

**Before (headcount-only model):**
- Sprint capacity = number of engineers x hours per sprint
- Maintenance work competes with feature work for the same pool of capacity
- Large campaigns (migrations, upgrades) take months because engineers cannot be fully dedicated
- Reactive work (incidents, CI failures) interrupts deep work
- Bench cost accumulates during ramp-up and between engagements

**After (human + agent model):**
- Sprint planning separates "human-judgment work" from "well-defined implementable work"
- Agent capacity handles the execution portion — no bench cost, no ramp-up delay
- Campaigns parallelize across child agents (weeks instead of months)
- Reactive work is handled by event-driven agents — humans review results asynchronously
- Engineers focus on architecture, design, and the problems that justify their billing rates

## Bench Economics and Attrition Risk

The human + agent model fundamentally changes the bench cost equation:

| Factor | Headcount-Only | Human + Agent Model |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Ramp-up cost** | Weeks to onboard new engineers to client systems | Agents onboard via blueprints and knowledge notes in minutes |
| **Bench cost during gaps** | Full salary continues between engagements | Agent capacity scales to zero when not in use — no idle cost |
| **Attrition risk** | Key engineers leave, taking institutional knowledge | Knowledge is encoded in playbooks, knowledge notes, and blueprints — survives staff turnover |
| **Surge capacity** | Requires hiring or subcontracting (weeks/months lead time) | Spin up additional agent sessions immediately (minutes) |
| **Specialization cost** | Each technology requires specialists on the bench | Agents typically handle a wide range of technologies with appropriate prompts and playbooks |

The margin improvement path: as playbooks mature and knowledge notes accumulate, agents' first-pass success rate improves, human review burden decreases, and margin expands over the life of an engagement.

## The Efficiency-Quality-Outcomes Cycle

The human + agent operating model creates a virtuous cycle:

1. **Efficiency first** — Agents handle high-volume, well-defined execution at consistent throughput. No idle time, no ramp cost, no context-switching loss.
2. **Quality rises** — Consistency and standardization (playbooks, automated review, automated testing) raise baseline quality without adding cost.
3. **Outcomes improve** — Fewer defects lead to less rework, faster delivery, shorter time-to-remediation, and more capacity for the next cycle.

This cycle compounds. Each engagement makes the next one cheaper and better because the playbooks, knowledge, and blueprints persist and improve.

## Knowledge Checks

**Knowledge Check 1.1**
Q: In the three-tier work distribution model, which tier handles parallelized migration campaigns across 50 microservices?
A) Judgment Tier (Human Engineers)
B) Execution Tier (Cloud Agents)
C) Acceleration Tier (Local Agents)
D) All three tiers equally
*Answer: B — Cloud agents parallelize well-defined, repetitive work across many targets. Humans review the PRs; they don't implement each one.*

**Knowledge Check 1.2**
Q: What happens to bench cost in the human + agent model when there is no active engagement work?
A) It increases because you need both humans and agent licenses
B) It stays the same — you still pay for the engineering team
C) Agent capacity scales to zero with no idle cost; only human bench remains
D) Agents are reassigned to internal R&D
*Answer: C — Agent capacity is consumption-based. When no work is running, agent cost is zero. Human bench cost still exists but is smaller because fewer engineers are needed for execution work.*

**Knowledge Check 1.3**
Q: Attrition risk is the risk that institutional knowledge walks out the door when engineers leave. Why does the human + agent delivery model reduce this risk for an SI?
A) Engineers are happier because they get paid more
B) Institutional knowledge is encoded in playbooks and knowledge notes rather than residing only in engineers' heads
C) Agents never leave the company
D) Engineers have less work to do
*Answer: B — When knowledge is codified in playbooks and knowledge notes, it survives staff turnover. A departing engineer's domain expertise persists in the system. While happier engineers may stay longer (A), the structural mitigation is that knowledge lives in the system, not in individual heads.*

**Knowledge Check 1.4**
Q: In the efficiency-quality-outcomes cycle, what drives quality improvement?
A) Hiring more QA engineers
B) Consistency and standardization from playbooks, automated review, automated testing, and expert feedback from code owners
C) Manual code review of every line
D) Reducing the number of deployments
*Answer: B — Standardized processes (playbooks, Devin Review, automated testing) combined with expert human review from code owners apply consistent rigor, raising baseline quality without adding headcount.*

## Key Takeaways

- Work distributes across three tiers: humans for judgment, cloud agents for execution, local agents for acceleration
- Sprint planning in the human + agent model separates judgment work (human-delivered) from execution work (agent-delivered)
- Bench cost, attrition risk, and ramp-up time are structurally reduced because agent capacity is elastic and knowledge is codified
- The efficiency-quality-outcomes cycle compounds over time as playbooks and knowledge mature
