# Value Narrative Selection

Mapping buyer personas to the right value narratives for effective positioning.

## Mapping Buyer Personas to Narratives

Different stakeholders care about different outcomes. The same human + agent delivery capability should be positioned differently depending on who you're talking to:

| Buyer Persona | Primary Narrative | Secondary Narrative | What They Need to Hear |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **CTO / VP Engineering** | Capacity Unlocking | Engineering Focus Elevation | "Your engineers stop doing mechanical work and focus on architecture and design. The backlog of deferred work actually gets done." |
| **CISO / Security Leadership** | Risk Reduction | Quality Improvement | "Vulnerability exposure windows shrink from 'next sprint' to 'next CI run'. PRs receive automated security review." |
| **FinOps / CFO** | Cost Optimization | Operating Model Efficiency | "Consumption-based pricing with measurable ROI. Each session produces attributable output. Licensing cost avoidance accelerates migration payback." |
| **Delivery Director / Program Manager** | Velocity Multiplication | Operating Model Efficiency | "Migration timelines compress from months to weeks. Parallel execution means campaigns finish before the client loses patience." |
| **Practice Lead / P&L Owner** | Operating Model Efficiency | Competitive Positioning | "Your cost structure becomes the most competitive in RFP scenarios. Margin expands as playbooks mature." |

## The Narrative Details

### For CTO / VP Engineering: Capacity Unlocking + Engineering Focus Elevation

**Lead with:** "Your engineers are spending 60%+ of their time on implementation work that could be delegated. The human + agent model shifts that distribution — engineers focus on architecture, design, and the decisions that require human judgment."

**Supporting points:**
- Show the backlog of deferred "should-do" work (dependency updates, test coverage, documentation debt)
- Quantify sprint points consumed by maintenance vs. feature development
- Position agents as unlocking capacity that already exists in the team's backlog
- Frame as team augmentation, not replacement — the engineering team becomes more effective, not smaller

**Evidence to provide:**
- Before/after sprint allocation (60% implementation → 30% implementation + 30% review)
- Time-to-complete for routine tasks (hours of implementation → minutes of review)
- Backlog velocity improvement when maintenance is automated

### For CISO / Security Leadership: Risk Reduction + Quality Improvement

**Lead with:** "Your vulnerability exposure window goes from 'next sprint' to 'next CI run' because findings are remediated as soon as they are detected."

**Supporting points:**
- Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) drops when agents respond automatically
- Consistency — agents do not skip the security scan because the sprint is tight
- Closed-loop verification — scan, remediate, re-scan, confirm
- Knowledge bus factor decreases — security policies encoded in playbooks survive staff changes

**Evidence to provide:**
- MTTR reduction for critical findings (sprint cycles → hours)
- Percentage of PRs receiving automated security review (high coverage with Devin Review)
- Compliance audit trail (SBOM generation, remediation documentation)

### For FinOps / CFO: Cost Optimization + Operating Model Efficiency

**Lead with:** "Consumption-based pricing with directly attributable ROI. Sessions produce measurable output — PRs merged, findings remediated, tests added. No idle cost."

**Supporting points:**
- ACU budgets provide hard spend controls at org, team, or user level
- ROI is directly measurable (compare ACU cost to equivalent engineer-hours)
- Licensing cost avoidance — migration from expensive platforms (COBOL/mainframe, SAS, Oracle Forms) to open alternatives accelerates when agents execute the migration
- Predictable budgeting — agent costs are forecastable, unlike variable human productivity

**Evidence to provide:**
- Cost per unit of work (agent) vs. cost per unit of work (engineer)
- Licensing cost savings from accelerated platform migrations
- Budget predictability improvement (variance reduction in sprint-over-sprint costs)

### For Delivery Director: Velocity Multiplication + Operating Model Efficiency

**Lead with:** "The timeline for this migration drops from months to weeks because agents parallelize the implementation and engineers review the PRs."

**Supporting points:**
- Parent-child orchestration processes N targets in parallel
- Timeline compression is dramatic for campaigns with many similar targets
- Engineers are not blocked on each other — agents work independently on isolated branches
- Risk is contained — each unit produces its own PR; failures in one do not affect others

**Evidence to provide:**
- Timeline comparison (sequential human vs. parallel agent execution)
- Throughput metrics (units completed per week)
- Quality metrics (defect rate per unit, rework rate)

## The Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to select your primary and secondary narratives before a client conversation:

```
Step 1: Identify the buyer's role
Step 2: Identify their primary pain point
Step 3: Select the matching narrative from the table above
Step 4: Prepare evidence specific to their context
Step 5: Anticipate objections based on their persona
```

| Pain Point | Narrative to Lead With | Key Metric |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| "We can't hire fast enough" | Capacity Unlocking | Story points reclaimed from maintenance |
| "Our security posture is reactive" | Risk Reduction | MTTR for critical findings |
| "Migrations take too long" | Velocity Multiplication | Timeline compression ratio |
| "We're losing RFPs on price" | Operating Model Efficiency | Cost per unit of work |
| "Our engineers are doing grunt work" | Engineering Focus Elevation | % time on design vs. implementation |
| "We can't predict project costs" | Unit-of-Work Economics | Estimation variance reduction |

## Positioning by Your Role

The buyer persona mapping above tells you *what* to say. This section tells you *which narratives to lead with* based on your own role in the conversation.

### Sales Engineering
- Lead with **Capacity Unlocking** and **Velocity Multiplication** — these resonate with engineering leaders who feel understaffed
- Show **event-driven patterns** (incident response, security remediation) as "set it and forget it" value
- Use the **divide-and-conquer** pattern to demonstrate scale that is impossible with manual approaches

### Solution Delivery
- Lead with **playbooks** and **design patterns** — these map directly to engagement deliverables
- Emphasize **toolchain-agnostic stubs** — clients do not need to change their tool stack
- Show **scheduled sessions** as ongoing value that extends beyond the initial engagement

### Systems Integrators and Managed Service Delivery
- Lead with **Operating Model Efficiency** — the hybrid model (human + digital workers) produces the most competitive cost structure for bidding
- Show the **unit-of-work estimation** model — standardized agent tasks have low variance, making bids more predictable and margins more defensible
- Frame **scalability without staffing risk** — agent capacity scales immediately without bench cost, recruitment lag, or attrition risk
- Name the **competitive displacement risk** — in RFP scenarios, the SI with the most efficient operating model wins

### Training and Enablement
- Lead with the **collaboration model** — Devin works the way engineers already work (PRs, CI, code review)
- Use **hands-on labs** to let participants experience capabilities in a safe environment
- Emphasize the **continuous improvement cycle** — Devin gets more effective as the team invests in configuration

### Executive Leadership
- Lead with **Risk Reduction** and **Cost Optimization** — these are the decision-making factors
- Frame Devin as **team augmentation**, not replacement — the engineering team becomes more effective, not smaller
- Show the **compounding value** model — initial setup investment yields growing returns over time
- For P&L owners: show the **efficiency → quality → outcomes cycle** — efficiency gains are the entry point, and the financial impact grows over time
